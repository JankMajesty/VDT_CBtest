# CollectionBuilder-GH Project Overview

## Purpose
CollectionBuilder-GH is a Jekyll-based static site generator designed for creating simple digital collection exhibits on GitHub Pages. It is intended as a teaching tool for hands-on learning about digital libraries, minimal computing, and web development.

## Key Features
- Generates free and simple digital collection sites using GitHub Pages
- Requires only a CSV of collection metadata and digital objects (JPEG images, PDFs, MP3s, or YouTube/Vimeo links)
- Template-based approach designed for librarians and DH practitioners
- Educational focus with "collections as data" and minimal computing principles

## Target Audience
- Digital knowledge workers in libraries and museums
- Students learning about digital libraries
- Workshop participants learning about digitization and metadata
- Users teaching/learning Git, GitHub, Markdown, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Jekyll

## Limitations
- Only suitable for small collections (GitHub repositories limited to 1GB)
- Lower resolution images required
- For larger collections, users should check out CollectionBuilder-CSV

## Project Philosophy
- "Convention over configuration" - follow examples rather than learn all options
- Commonly understood formats (CSV over YAML)
- Educational outlook with extensive inline documentation
- Simple, comprehensible code structure for non-developers
- Minimal computing approach
