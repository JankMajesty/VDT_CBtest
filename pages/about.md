## About the Collection

The Vicksburg Daily Times was a newspaper published in Vicksburg, Mississippi during the Reconstruction Era following the American Civil War. This digital collection provides access to newspaper pages from the 1860s, documenting a pivotal period in American and Mississippi history.

### Source Materials

These digitized newspaper images are courtesy of the Briscoe American History Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The Briscoe Center is home to extensive collections documenting Texas and U.S. history, including significant holdings of historical newspapers and publications.

### Historical Context

Published during Reconstruction, the Vicksburg Daily Times provides a window into the political, social, and economic conditions of post-Civil War Mississippi. Vicksburg, having been the site of a crucial Civil War siege in 1863, was a significant location during this transformative period in American history.

### Thematic Organization

This collection is organized around three key themes of Reconstruction: the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867, African American Suffrage, and Southern Lost Cause Mentality. Visit our [Themes page]({{ '/themes.html' | relative_url }}) to explore scholarly analysis and browse newspapers by theme.

### OCR and AI Tools

OCR tools (ABBYY FineReader) were used to generate text from the historic newspaper images. OCR-generated text of historic newspapers is never 100% accurate due to the quality of the digitized image and the technology used.

AI tools (Claude Code Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, GPT-4) were used in the construction of this website. There was a human-in-the-loop verifying the integrity of outputs at every step of the process.

### About This Project
