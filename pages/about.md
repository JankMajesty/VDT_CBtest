## About the Collection

The Vicksburg Daily Times Digital Library showcases digitized newspaper issues covering news primarily impacting Mississippi and the broader South in the year 1867. These papers contain important information revealing Southern attitudes toward African American suffrage, the Reconstruction Act and ensuing military occupation of the South, as well as the Lost Cause mythology embraced by many Southerners.

### Source Materials

The Vicksburg Daily Times came to the [Dolph Briscoe American Center for American History](https://briscoecenter.org/) through the acquisition of the [Natchez Trace Collection](https://briscoecenter.org/collections/american-south/). The collection was initially funded by wealthy Confederate veteran George W. Littlefield, who incidentally was an adherent to the Southern Lost Cause mentality expressed in this library’s materials. The original purpose of the collection – which was to effectively whitewash Southern history – has significantly changed since its inception. This digital library aims to honestly reckon with the violent legacy of Mississippi through its interpretation of the collection, motivated by a desire to assist humanities researchers analyzing the postwar South. 


### Historical Context

Published during Reconstruction, The Vicksburg Daily Times provides a window into the political, social, and economic conditions of post-Civil War Mississippi. Vicksburg, having been the site of a crucial Civil War siege in 1863, was a significant location during this transformative period in American history.

### Thematic Organization

This collection is organized around three key themes of Reconstruction: the Military Reconstruction Act of 1867, African American Suffrage, and Southern Lost Cause Mentality. Visit our [Themes page]({{ '/themes.html' | relative_url }}) to explore scholarly analysis and browse newspapers by theme.

### About This Project

This digital collection was created by students of the Digital Libraries course at the University of Texas at Austin School of Information. The students received 40 digitized issues of The Vicksburg Daily Times and generated metadata for each issue. 15 of the 40 issues were carefully selected to present on this website according to the selected three key themes.

### OCR and AI Tools

OCR tools (ABBYY FineReader) were used to generate text from the historic newspaper images. OCR generated text of historic newspapers is never 100% accurate due to the quality of the digitized image and the technology used.

AI tools (Claude Code Sonnet 4.5 and Haiku 4.5, Cursor, OpenAI Codex, GPT-5) were used in the construction of this website. There was a human-in-the-loop verifying the integrity of outputs at every step of the process.
