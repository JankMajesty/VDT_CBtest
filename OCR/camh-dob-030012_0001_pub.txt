iA8 A PLEVENTEVE,
ch VllLK-WOLIchN ARRESTED FOR STEPHENS.
A rfieent number of. the Cork Herald
furnishes us with the annexed amusing am ,
eeifnf 6 f an effort of a sagacious English
myrmidon w Harn toe proposed' rewa rd of
£1000 for the capture of Stephens:	< -
AboutfiaTspast seven o’c oek, on Sit',. ,
turday evening; Deb. 8th, a milkwoman
called at the Cat Port Barracks. She was
greatly muffled Up and had'a stye on her
M. A, young English soldier, who hap-
pened to be otu guard, challenged her ;
knock. She replied, „in Irish something
that, in Me mind of toe than of arms;
sounded like ‘ Brother Fenian.” This
had a terrible effect opoR -him. He com-
muned with, himself for a, f, W; mom epts.	,
Meantime; toe woman knocked again,,
and he considered it advisable to look at
her thrSlMh a porthole. He saw her; she
was exactly the' height of Stephens; she
' had toe same flabby faoej the sameflqwing
locks, toe same small hands, tat immense'
ly big Het, with immensely bigger Shoes.
He con^uded. that-she was ths celebrated
herdFentkp; in disguse. J^efore placing
her unflex afresHne wasdetoftapeq fy test
’ his coftelDion by haying'an interview with
her, and seeing if her left bye would wink
while she ,was speaking to hifn—ond of the
unerring characteristics of Mr. Stephen’s
left optic whenever that gen tleman is en-
.garbed in converaation. The gat& was
opened and the milkwomen entered. Not
soon r had she got inside than she was in
themMly gtasp of toe burly syldier^
■He adcfresSed her and Me tep&a : he
watched’her face eagerly; but she was un-
conscious' of what-was going to. happen.
He MS satisfied ttat his suriflises were
• correct ;*djer left eye kept opening and
•’ shutting incesrantly while toe interview
lasted."	. / ■	.	"...
The poor women was quietly shoved into
1 toe guard room , and then the preparations
1 for defending the fort commenced. The
! men were .aroused from their qutetude/
" and the guard told them What he had done.
[ Sentries, .Withdrawn beyond, were placed
1 on the guard-room door to prevent the es-
!" eapO dr the state prisoner, the ramparts
were mounted, the port-holes surrounded,
and toe ordnance properly poised. ,In the
'■ meantime, a messenger bad btan sent to
“ toe commapding officer of the head gatrif
1 son to anpfise nim Of the arrest.
“At tnis juncture thejnessman came out 1
of the kitchen and inquired what was Me,
meaning bf ta this fuSs. He Was fold that*-
his comradfes had captured Stevens, whom
they had tfapn safely lodged in the guards
room The messman took a peep at the
great prize through toe window. There
Be st®n crjring the poor Woman, who
‘brought him his supply of milk.' Me in-,
dulged in an immorderato, fit of laughter,
and had the Woman liberated. It was then
found that she was suffering from a sty in
toe left eye, and, that consequently that
optic winked very frequently while she
spoke. This was how. Stephens was cap-
tured on Saturday.”
An Interesting Incident.—In toe
midst of our sorrows, it is refreshing to
note, even in the humblest ranks-of life,
an instinctive return .fo those sacred duties
and touching amenities which, once united
us all as brothers.	■
When; on day before yesterday,- toe fu-
) neral fitocession of the’ late- Capt. W. D
Smith was*neanng the camp of toe 15th
regulars, and just before toe officer com-
manding ordered back the train, the sol-
dier standing- seritinei in front of toe color
line; halted as the corpse passed by and
gate it..a marching salute, atid, even after
nis superior officer had turned off the pro-
cessiOn/the same weather beaten' veteran
again gave .the departed brave Me same
mark of respect.	.	.
Perhaps theteld soldier was thinking that
he too, might Me day fall on a foreign soil,
ata instinctively felt Mat his humble re-
mains should, not be submitted to any in-
dignity, after their spirit had- taken its
flight.—[Mobile Times.
