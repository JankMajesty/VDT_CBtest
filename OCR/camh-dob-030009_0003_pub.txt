NO MORE CONSUMPTION.
Grimault's Syrup of Hypophospate of Lime.
For all Diseases of the Chest this medicine is in-
valuable; it is largely used at the "Bromp-jg
ton Hospital,” in London, for Con-
sumption . and generally ap-
proved by the leading med-.
ical men in England
and in France.

NO MORE POVERTY OF THE BLOOD
AND PALE COMPLEXION.
Dr. Lera's Phosphate of Iron.
This new ferruginous medicine contains the
elements of the blood and bones and iron in a
liquid state. It is different from all hitherto
offered to the public as liquid, colorless and
tasteless. It speedils cures
Chlorois,
Pains in the Stomach,
Difficult Digestion,
. Dysmenorrh<ea, Anemia.
The majority of the Academies of Medicine of
Paris recommend the Phosphate of Iron to La-
dies of delicate constitution suffering from Ane-
mia; and all other persons fatigued from over
anxiety, nervous emotions, overwork, general
debility and poorness of blood.
It is une only preparation which never causes
constipation, and can be borne by the most deli-
cate stomachs,
Dr. BURIN DU BUILSON’S
Digestive Lozenges and Powders of the Al-
caline Lactates.
TheAlcaline Lactates exercise the mosVbenl?
eficial influence over the derangements of diges-
tion, either by their peculiar action on the mu-
cous membrane of the sfomach, or by affording
to the latter through their combination with the
saliva to the gastric i nice, a supply of Lactic acid,
which all English, French and other physiolo-
gists, admit w be an essential principle oi diges-
tion. For the information of those who may be
without medical advice, it may be stated here
that the symptoms of impaired digestion are:
headache, pain in the forehead, hemicrania, gas-
tritis, heartburn, wind in the stomach and Dow-
els, loss of appetite, emaciation, etc. All these
soon appear under the action of the Alcaline Lac-
tates, which may he always had in Lozenges or
Powders.
Grimault's Capsules and Liquid Extract oj
Matico Veg stalls.
Where al other medicines have failed, these
preparations will always effect a cure.
These insure rapid and extraordinary cure of
severe, recent and chronic cases of private dis
ease. They are used in the Hospitals of Paris,
by the celebrated Dr. Ricord, and are found
greatly superior to all hitherto known mineral
remedies and cobaiba and cubebs. The injec-
tion is used in recent, and capsules in more
chxonic cases.	——

A FEW WORDS OF COMMON SENSE, I
How few there are who are not subject to’
some affection of the lungs or respiratory-x.
gans who, by neglecting premonitory sympj
toms, aggravate tfie complaint, until? disease
strikes its shafts, causing inexpressible torture;
to the patient, and anxiety and distress^
friends. ‘‘Only a cold I” "A slight sore throat!”
is the heedless remark of many when so affect
ed. Yes; "Only a cold,” was the thoughtlessW
expression of thounsands whom death hajj
marked as his prey.	g
Forewarned—Forearmed! should be the mot J
forever in the minds of all subject to Coughs®
Colds, Catarrh, or Influenza. Words of advice®
should be heeded by all suffering from Asthma®
bronchitis,Consumption. Relief is within theirl
reach; and, if neglected, fatal consequences]
ensue—a life of misery—a daily, hourly strug.®
gle for existence. A contest in which there]
can be but one victor—Death I	|
Does it not appal the strongest mind, to thhft]
of the result caused by neglect? Then why de.I
lay? What excuse can be offered, when tiMeW
warning is sounded in your ears? When th,]
danger is pointed out, yfhy not avoid it? Margil
den’s Pectoral Balin has been used w^l
success in nearly a million of cases, and is
dorsed by the Medical Faculty as the mosl
prompt and efficacious remedy that scientific!
research has discovered, to relieve and cure all!
cases of Coughs, Colds, Influenza, and Consump.1
tion, if the case is not beyond all hope. Even]
when the sufferer is in the last stages, he will]
find relief by using this preparation. One bot.1
tie will convince the most incredulous, that the
merits of this preparation are by no means ex-
aggerated; in fact—fall far short of the eulogies!
. bestowed upon it by thousands who have been
cured by its timely use. A guarantee accomJ
panics each bottle, and dealers are instructed’
in every instance to Refund the money, when
this preparation fails to relieve.

MARSDEN’S CALtSAYA TONIC.
As an alterative, it far surpasses any of the
fictitious preparations with which the country
is flooded, under the cognomen of Sarsaparilla,
Syrups, Lc. It is Composed of true Calisaya,
Bark, in its most concentrated form, combined
with drugs long and popularly known for their
virtue in purifying the blood and cleansing it
from a scrofulous taint. Calisaya Bark has
been long known to the medical profession,
having been introduced by the Jesuits nearly
two hundred years ago, since which time it has
been stpadily gaining in popular favor, till it is
now recognized as the most reliable tonic and
febrifuge extant. Marsden’s Calisaya Tonic
will be found invhluable in all cases of erup-
tions, blotches, pimples, salt rheum, and scor-
butic affections, neutralizing the effect of hu-
mor in the system, and eradicating all poison
Qom the blood. In convalescence from febrile
or cutaneous diseases, this preparation can be
used with beneficial effect, as it assists nature
to recover from the the debilitory causes inci-
dent to malarious or malignant fevers.
As an Invigorator in loss of appetite, debility,
dyspepsia, or night sweats, it stands pre-emi-
nent, imparting vitality . to the stomach,
assisting the digestive organs to perform their
functions, and imparting life and strength to
the system. The favorable report of thousands
who have been benefited by this preparation
justifies us in offering to all a guarantee that
the merits claimed for this medicine fall far
short of its intrinsic worth to all sufferers from
the above complaints.;'

WORDS ADDRESSED TO ALL.
When the system is relaxed by the oppressive
heats of Summer, it becomes more or less pre-
disposed to absorb the poisons arising from re-
fuse and offal with which our cities abound.
This is one of the prevailing causes of the dis-
eases which are subject to. at this season of the
year, viz: Diarrhea, Dysentery, Cholera, and
last, though not least, looseness, of the bowels,
which is a forerunner of these complaints, and
ought, in every instance, be checked. By neg-
lecting the premonitory symptoms, the bowels
become relaxed to a degree which often termi-
nates in that fatal scourge, Cholera. The ques-
tion naturally suggests itself, how can we pre-
vent these diseases, and, if suffering, what is
the cure? The grand preventive is cleanliness
and pure air. The cure, Marsdon’s Carminative
Syrup, a preparation composed of Gums and
Barks indigenous to South America, where the
formula has been adopted as being most effica-
cious in all disorders of the bowels.
Marsden’s Carminative Syrup never failing
to relieve and cure every case of Diarrhea, Dys-
entery and Cholera.

New York.

CAN CONSUMPTION BE CURED?
This question is so anxiously asked by the
Consumptives, our answer is, that Pulmonary
Consumption, or other diseases of the Lungs,
are as curable as any other diseases if the right
remedies are promptly used. That it can * be
cured there is no doubt, as has been repeatedly
and amply proved by autopsies on thousands of
bodies of men and women in the Hospitals ot
Europe; these autopsies showing that the cica-
trization of the cavities of the lungs had been
affected during the life of the patient, proving
conclusively that Consumption^ can be cured!
The next question arises as to the metins. Om
that subject there exists as great a variety of
opinions as there are practitioners—some advo-
cating one theory, and some another. It is ad-
mitted by all the Profession, that the discoverer
of any remedy which would generally relieve
and cure Phthisis, Tubercular ahd Pulmonary
'Consumption, would be the greatest benefactor
of the age. The cure has been discovered and
is daily relieving thousands who would other-
wise have been victims of the grave. Pectoral
Balm is the Great Remedy, and for all diseases
of the Pulmonar Organs stands without an
equal. The Proprietor, confident of the impar-
tial judgment and hpnor of the Profession, will
cheerfully furnish a bottle of Pectoral Balm to
any respectable Physician, so that a fair trial
can be given of its merits, aud a true report
given. All that is asked is, that the sufferer
from any Bronchial diseases, tries it. and we
are satisfied he will recommend it to all.
