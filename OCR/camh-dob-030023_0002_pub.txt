THE 1ST EPISTLe'oF THE VICKS-

And 10! 204 behold! It came 0 pass,
that ٤٥ plug-hatted, s de-whi kered 000-
pie, who have there 0011 1010 0012099 ع the
Far North, 10004 out 000م the prosperous
20لم happy people 0٤ the South, and saw
that 9٧ were 110٠
And they immediately rose 111, and
spoke one to another, saying: “Let us
send certain 1000 0٤ US ٤0 800 out this
teeming land, that they may return ٤0 US
with truthful tidings.”
And they sent forth certain men :مام the
f.'r-off Southern country, who returned
unto 91 saying, “This cauntry abound,
eth in fatness, and the 000010 09 مم
%004 dwelling there, possess 1010 20008
20 many cattle, and ٤91[ women are
decked with rare and precious jewels, and
the tables 0٤ their 110 100 arc spread
with dainty food, and vessels 0٤ silver 200
0٤gold: 24 all the people are clothed 10
costly raiment.” ٨04 then the 0090 0٤
0 North put their heads together, and
powwowed muchly, 200 some among them
8214: “Let 08 اهع together many 1000 and
guns, and 0ع down upon these people 0٤
the South, 204 take away from them all
theircattle, and jewels, and gold, and sil-
ver, yea, verily, even to the last mustard
80000 : yea, verily, let US 20 for 'em.' 1
And 019 werp 8000 among them slow
to speak, and 0٤ exceeding-great cunning,
211080 ٥٢ لم up and said: “۶08 ٠؛ not 00
18 thing, lor 1٤ we 80014 do this thing,
the eyesof00114 00لل look down upon

aggravate, and threaten, and harass, and
bully these people: and 35 they areaquick
and brave people, it will 00009 ٤0 pass, that
they «111 attack US, and then we will 20
down 1100 them, yea, verily, like unto a
thousand 0٤ brick: 204 9 being many,
0ل they few, *9 will ٤20 0 all their

And it 04100 ٤0 pass that these men 0ا
the North did as they said they 01014 do
-yea, the things 10 ٤0٢ had pow,

But it 20 happened, that the Southern
army was an army 0٤ great 10001308 and

skedaddled. 1 say unto you, men 30ل
brethren, they did get up and dust, and
never halted for a soda-cocktail until they
were behind the Capitol at Washington.
And thus it 02108 0ا pass, اهطا he great
army 0و٤ ٤ North did not take Richmond.
ا No, verily I say unto you, not by a jug-
full. Al after this, there was much
strife and many battles, and the Confed-
. erates whipped 910 at Bull Run, and
: licked them at 90٢0 Pines, 110 gave
rise to ٤9 classic 90102, “We 110004 ’em

we give 'em hell 50٢00 ام Pines, 1 lay ten

؛ But ٤11 Yankees had seen the richness
٠	0٤ the Southern land, 8104 they drafted
٠	10019 men, and sent off and ا0ع Dutchmen
ا by ٤109 thousand, and enlisted contrabands,
٠	until 100 had more than a million 0٤ sol-

plundered, 204 stole, and burned, and
sacked, and pillaged for four years, until
they conquered the gallant little South—

THE MEERSCHAUM PIPE.
