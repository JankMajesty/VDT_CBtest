From the Selma Messenger.]
THE PRINTER.
From a series of Discources delivered before
the Selma Starvation Association, or-
ganized for the purpose • of discovering
“Who shall Last the Longest,” or “Who
Laid the Rails”—the proceeds to be appro-
priated for the benfit of Deceased Soldiers of
Confederate Widows and Orphans. Con-
tributions caWbe forwarded to the author,
to be disposed of according to his own su-
peror judgement.
BYPHATTE KOPPIE, JR., P. T. (PROFESSOR
OF TYPOGRAPHY.)
Printers are a peculiar class of persecuted
professionals, who have existed ever since
the days of that good old man Faust, who
cast his type out of boxwood, and printed
his paper on a cider press. The extin'
guished individual who said that the press
was the lever that moved the world, might
have added that the printer was the leaver
who always left without paying his board.
The most predominating characteristic
of the printer, is that he rarely ever has
any tobacco or whisky money. Her may
also be known by his pocket-knife, which
is usually a “barlow” or a buck'horn han.
die, with one blade, which is generally
broken off about the middle and worn very
slick on the end from frequent gouging at
“quoins,” and scraping on the grate while
waiting for “copy.’
It is very seldom you ever see the coffers
of a typo overflowing with the “root of all
evil,” as he devotes but a small portion of
his valuable time to looking after his finan-
cial affairs, and it is not extremely probai
ble that one will be appointed Secretary of
the Treasury _ under the administration of
the few Presidents we are too have, or
Cashier of the First National Bank of Sel-
ma. The remark occurs somewhere be-
tween the title page and fly-leaf of the
back part of the Bible that it is easier for
a cambric needle to go through the eye of
a domedary than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven—especially if he’s
a printer; and some acting upon this prim
ciple, seem to have deliberately resolved
to die poor. Some seem to fear that fhe
next telegraphic report from New York
will bring news of a decline in gold, and
theyliasten to invest their hard-seamed
greenbacks in the “grocery business,”
thereby receiving the full benefit thereof,
and averting the terrible consequences or
a financial crash. An old “regular” was
lately heard to remark that it was “a burn-
ing shame for him to have to spend money
for board and clothes when a fresh invoice
of Robinson county whisky had just ar-*
rived at the drawing room of the Gee
House. Printers are also kept poor be^
cause of the fact that most people think
they have no use for money, and try to
get all the money they can from them,
and give as little as possible of everything
in return for it.
Printers are never at much expense for
lodging, as they generally sleep on a sheet
of paper, on the office floor, and pillow
their devoted heads on a “mallet,” conso1
ling themselves with the mental hallucina-
tion that “there’s a better day coming,
hallelqjah I”---a species of ^economy re-
sorted to for the purpose of saving money
to buy whisky, which is highly commend,
ed by the editorial profession, but not par-
ticularly recommended to the youth of our
unfortunate country. When they get up
jn the morning, they Wash their face in
the lye kettle, wipe it on an old newspaper,
and brush their hair and whiskers with the
blackingbrush.
The morals of a‘printer, in one sense of
the word are unexceptionable. We knew
a fair haired youth his mothers darling and
father’s pride, whose bosat was that he
could not be induced by the tempations of
the “devil” or flowing bowl to deviate from
the path of virture. and moral culture
which had boon instilled into his youthful
mind. In an evil hour his fond parent
placed him in the office of the Broad-Axe
of Liberty, to learn the “art preservative;’’
in one short week he was taken home on a
window shutter; a melancholy evidence of
the frailty of human nature and the ter-
rible consequences of coming in contact
with printers and Robinson county whisky.
Another peculiarity about this interes’
ting class is, when they travel, they either
walk or ride, which depends altogether
on whether they’ve got any money; and
as they invariably haven’t got any, they
always walk. Sometimes they travel as
"dead-heads ’ on steamboats, which inter-
esting ceremony consists principally in
“firing up,” helping to load and unload
the boat, sleeping under the boilers, and
eating slush with the mutton-luggers and
flunkies.
His wardrobe is composed mostly of the
following articles, to-wit: one pair socks,
one pair kid gloves, one calico shirt and a
paper collar, which he usually carries in
his hat, or in a trunk about the size of a
stern-wheel steamer, the remainder of the
“ballast” being made up of “exchanges,”
loose smoking tobacco, one Congressional
Report, a “specimen book,” “Treatise on
Punctuation,’’ “Adam’s Typography,”
and an “Essay on ‘seven-up.” Another
noticable fact is that a Printer has only v
linen duster or some coat of light material
to warm his shivering body in the Winter,
while in the Summer he generally wears a
heavy over-coat.
. Policemen are very fond of printers, and
evince their attachment by lending a help'
ing hand (so-called,) when , they see one
trying to climb a lamp-post, practicing the
Corkscrew polka, or endeavoring to stand
on his head on the sidewalk. May the
bands of friendship that bind the printer
and poor Beeman never grow any tighter !
and we don’t think they will—not to any
great extent. The promptitude with
which the unfortunate devils respond to
the call of “five dollars and better,” has
created a sort of municipal affection for
them.
Some of them, however, have condes-
cended to lower themselves so far beneath
their native dignity as to go to Congress or
the United States Senate; and there is an
instance related of one who had the auda-
city to bottle up lightning, which he sold
to New Jersey distillers to make Jersey
lightning whisky—the most of which has
been shipped to Selma. His name was
Franklin. He also acquired a little repm
tation abroad as a philosopher. For furth-
er particulars see small bills.
The printer is an unfathomable, mystc
rious fortune-maker for everybody else but
himself] his favorite drink is chain-light-
ing whisky, dashed with aquafortis and
stirred with a lightning rod; his “forte”
is to set type at from forty to seventy.five
cents per thousand; and his motto is—
“Greenbacks are good, but Robinson coun-
ty whisky is better.”

On the bosom.of the river
Where the siin unloosed his quiver,
Where the starlight streams forever,
Sailed a a vessel light and free.
Morning dew-drops hung like manna,
On the bright folds of her banner;
While the zephyrs rose to fan her
Softly to the radiant sea.
At her brow a pilot beaming,
In the flush of youth stood'dreaming.
And he was in glorious seeming,
Like an an^ei from above.
Through his hair the breezes sported,
And as on the Wave he floated.
Of that pilot, apgeLthroated;
Warbled, lays of hope and love.
Through these locks so brightly flowing,
Buds of laurel bloom were blowing,
And his hands anoh were throwing
Music from a lyre of gold.
Swifter down the stream he glided,.
Soft the purple waves divided,
And a rainbow arch abided
On his canvass’s snowy fold.
Anxious hearts with fond devotion,
Watching him sailing to the ocean,.
Prayed that no wild commotion
’Midst the element might rise.
And he seemed some young Apollo,
Charming summer winds to follow,
While the water-flags, carolla
Trembled to his music sighs.
But these purple waves enchanted,
Rolled beside a city, haunted
By an awful spell; that daunted
Every cover to her shore.
Night shades rank the air encumberd.
And pale marble statutes numbered,
Awoke to life no more.
Then there rushed with lightning quickness,
O’er his face a mortal sickness,
And the dews in tearful thickness
Gathered-d’er his temples fair.
And there swept a dying murmur
Through the lovely Southern summer ,
As the beauteous pilot comer
Perished by that city there.
Still rolls on that radiant river,
And the sun unbinds his quiver
O’er the starlight streams forever
On its bosom as before.
But that vessel’s rainbow banner
Greets no more the gay savannah,
And that pilot’s lute drops manna
On the purple waves no more.
Statue of Marshall Arrived.
The bronze statue of Chief’Justice
Marshall, which is to occupy one of
the lower pedestals of the Washington
Monument, was brought to this City
yesterday from New York, by the
steamship Albemarle, and landed at
the wharf at Rocketts. It was ship-
ped from Rotterdam by a sailing ves-
sel last December. A gentleman of
this city, to whom it was consigned,
has made arrangements with Messrs.
Bossieux & Brother, to have it depos-
ited to-day at the foot of the Monu-
ment. The -formidable character of
the job of its removal from the wharf
to the square may be judged,when we
state that it weighs between three and
four tone, and is enclosed in a box
thirteen feet long, five feet highland
five feet eleven inches wide.
This is the first of the Rogers’ stat-
ues for the Monument that has arrived.
The Henry and Jefferson were done
by Crawford, and after the death of
that artist was finished by Rogers,who
obtained, from the State of Virginia
the contract for the completion of the
Monument. Mr. Rogers’Nelson and
Lewis, and .the bronze ornaments for
the lower portions of the Monument,
are all completed; and may at any time
be expected to arrive. The work of
elevating this statute to its pedestal
devolves upon the State, and we learn
it is the purpose of the Governor to
have. it done with as little delay as
practicable. .The bronze image of
Virginia’s great jurist, even though
erected at an hour when every sem-
blance of civil law seems about to be
trampled out in his native State, must
excite* a .more than common interest
here where are still living many of
the descendants and relatives and per-
sonal friends of the illustrious origi-
nal.
The Wiles of a Fair Deceiver.—A
short time since a modest and captiv-
ating young lady, calling herself Nelly
Sweet, visited Detroit, as she said, in
search of her brother, who was repre-
sented to have been killed on one of
the railroads of that State, Her quiet
ways and great beauty captivated tbe
hearts of all around her, and she be-
came a great favorite. At a party
recently given, she appeared as an in-
vited guest, and succeeded, almost
unconsciously, in winning the heart of
a wealthy young man, answering to
the not very romantic name of Henry.
Henry danced with the fair Nelly of-
ten, and, after the festivities, walked
with her home. A short courtship
followed, and the parties were engaged
to be married, on St. Valentine’s day.
A few days before the ceremony was
to be performed, which would make
two loving hearts one, the young man
visited his affianced, and to his sur-
prise found her in tears. He tenderly
inquired the cause, and after much
coaxing, was informed that she had
been disappointed in receiving
remittances from home that she
was in debt to her landlady and had no
money to buy her wedding finery, conse-
quently the wedding must be postponed
for a few days. Henry would listen to no
such proposition, but he would go straight
and bring the money. He departed, and
in a few moments returned with a five
hundred dollar bill, at the same time tel-
ling her if she needed more to let him
know.
The evening before the day appointed
for the marriage, he determined to spend
a few hours with his beloved, and repaired
to the reading room, but alas, Nellie was
not there. The bird had flown. The
landlady said she had packed up her
things early that morning, and had taken

An interesting question.
What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those anected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease than chose possessed of strong and
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition? We answer, .by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic,

PHILADELPHIA.
This Bitters is a compound of fluid extracts.
The roots and herbs from which it is made are
gathered in Germany,, and their virtues, in the
form of extracts, extracted by one of the most
scientific chemits and pharmaceutists this coun-
try affords. It is
NOT A LIQUOR PREPARATION,
in any sense of the word; contains no whisky,
rum. or any other intoxicating ingredients, and
can be freely used in families without any fear
or risk of those using it contracting the disease
or vice Of intemperance. We wish this fact
distinctly understood, as many others before
the public are prepared from liquor of some kind.
During the	J

A member of the family has been for many
years a perfect Martyr to Dyspepsia, Palpita-

spings bl a torpid liver, until persuaded to try
the above celebrated remedy, which in a few
weeks resulted in making her (to use her own
words) “a new woman.”

see fit, or refer similar sufferers to

I have known Uoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably for a number of years. I have used
them in my’ own family, and have been so
pleased with their, effects, that ! was induced to
recommend them to many others^ and know
that they have operated in a strikingly benefi-
cial manner. I tahe great pleasure in thus pub-
licly proclaiming this^ fact, and. calling the at-
tention of those afilicted with the diseases for
which they are recdmmendhd, to this-Bitters,
knowing from experience th$it my recommend-
ation will be sustained. I do this more cheer-
fully as Hbbfland’s Bitters is intended to benefit
the afllicted, and is not a “rum drink.”
