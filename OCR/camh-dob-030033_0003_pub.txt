MARSDEN’S CALISAYA TONIC, r
As an alterative, it far surpasses any of the.
fictitious preparations with which the country
is flooded, under the cognomen of Sarsaparilla,
Syrups, Lc. It is composed of true Calisaya
Bark, in its most concentrated form, combined
with drugs long and popularly known for their
virtue in purifying the blood and cleansing it
from a scrofulous,, taint. Calisaya Bark has
been long known to the medical profession,
having been introduced by the Jesuits nearly
two hundred years ago, since which time it . is
been steadily gaining in popular favor, tih it Is
now recognized as the most reliable tonic and
febrifuge extant. Marsden’s Calisaya Tonic
will be found invaluable- in all cases of erup-
tions, blotches, pimples, salt rheum, and scor-
butic affections, neutralizing the effect of hu-
mor in the system, and eradicating all
from the blood. In convalescence from
or cutaneous diseases, this preparation
used with beneficial effect, as it assists
to recover from the the debilitory causes inci-
dent to malarious or malignant fevers.
As an Invigorator in loss of appetite, debility,
dyspepsia, or night sweats, it stands pre-emi-
nent, imparting vitality to the* stomach,
assisting the digestive organs to perform their
functions, and imparting life and strength to
the system. The favorable report of thousands
who have been benefited by this preparation
justifies us in offering to all a guarantee that
the merits claimed for this medicine fall far
short of its intrinsic worth to all sufferers from
the above complaints.;

Digestive Lozengt
calx__________
The Alcaline Lactates exercise the most|ben2
eficial influence over the derangements of diges-
tion, either by their peculiar action on the mu-
cous membrane of the stomach, or by affording
to the latter through their combination with the
saliva to the gastric j u ice, a supply of Lactic acid,
which all English, French and other physiolo-
gists, admit to be an essential principle of diges-
tion. For the information of those who may be
without medical advice, it may be stated here
that the symptoms of impaired digestion are:
headache, pain in the forehead, hemicrania, gas-
tritis, heartburn, wind in the stomach and bow-
els, loss of appetite, emaciation, etc. All these
soon appear under the action of the Alcaline Lac-
tates. which may be always had in Lozenges or
Powders.	---

greatly superior to all hitherto known mineral

tion is used in recent, and capsules in more

WORDS ADDRESSED TO ALL.
When the system is relaxed by the oppressive
heats of Summer, it becomes more or less pre-
disposed to absorb the poisons arising from re-
fuse and offal with which our cities abound.
This is one of the prevailing causes of the dis-
eases which are subject to. at this season of the
year, viz: Diarrhea, Dysentery, Cholera, and
last, though not least, looseness of the bowels,
which is a forerunner of these complaints, and
I ought, in every instance, be checked. By neg-
lecting the premonitory symptoms, the bowels
become relaxed to a degree w often termi ’
nates in that fatal scourge, Ch The ques-
tion naturally suggests itself, how can we pre-
vent these diseases, and, if suffering, what is
the cure? The grand preventive is cleanliness
and pure air. The cure, Marsdon’s Carminative
Syrup, a preparation jeomposed of Gums and
Barks indigenous to South America, where the
formula has been adopted as being most effica-
cious in all disorders of the bowels.
Marsden’s Carminative Syrup never failing
to relieve and cure every case of Diarrhea, Dys-
entery and Cholera.

CAN CONSUMPTION BE CURED?
This question is so anxiously asked by the
Consumptives, our answer is, that Pulmonary
Consumption, or other diseases of the Lungs,
are as curable as any other diseases if the right
remedies are promptly used. That it can be
cured there is no doubt, as has been repeatedly
‘and amply proved by autopsies on thousands of
bodies of men and women in the Hospitals or
Europe; these autopsies showing that the cica-
trization of the cavities of the lungs had been)
I affected during the life of the patient, proving/
conclusively that Consumption can be
The next question arises as to the means. On
that subject there exists as great a variety of
opinions as there are practitioners—some advo-
cating one theory, and some another. It is ad-
mitted by all the Profession, that the discoverer
of any remedy which would generally relieve
and cure Phthisis, Tubercular and Pulmonary
Consumption, would be the greatest benefactor
of the age. The cure has been discovered and
is Sally relieving thousands who would other-
wise have been victims of the grave. Pectoral
Balm is the Great Remedy, and for all diseases
of the - Pulmonar Organs stands without an
equal* The Proprietor, confident of the impar-
tial judgment and honor of the Profession, will
cheerfully furnish a bottle of Pectoral Balm to
any respectable Physician, so that a fair trial
can be given of its merits, aud a true report
given. All that is asked is, that the sufferer
from any Bronchial diseases tries it. and we
are satisfied he will recommend it to all.
