PHILADELPHIA
An interesting question.
What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those anected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease than those possessed of strong and.
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition?.- We answer, by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic,
HOOFLAND’S
GERMAN BITTERS
PREPARED BY
Dr. C. M. JACKSON.
PHILADELPHIA.
This Bitters is a compound of fluid extracts.
The roots and herbs from which it is made are
gathered in Germany, and their virtues, in the
form of extracts, extracted by one of the most
scientificchemiss and pharmaceutists this coun-
try affords. It is
NOT A LIQUOR PREPARATION,
ip any sense of the word; contains no whisky,
rum, or any other intoxicating ingredients, and
can be freely used in families without any fear
or risk of those using it contracting the disease
or vice of intemperance. We wish this fact
distinctly understood, as many others before
the public are prepared from liquor of some kind.
During the
CHOLERA SEASON
of 1849, this Bitters were extensively used
throughout the entire country
AS A PREVENTIVE,
and we have not heard of a single instance In
which this Bitters was used, where the persons
suffered from any of the symptoms of Cholera.
The Great Strengthening- Tonic,
HOOFLAND’S
German

Soldiers, Citizens, Male or Female, Adult
or Youth,
Wi 1 find this Bitters a pure Tonic, riot depend-
ent on bad liquors for their almost miraculous
effects.
This Bitters will, cure the most severe cases
of
DYSPEPSIA
And Diseases Resulting from Disorders of the
Digestive Oagans, and is the only sure, certain
and safe remedy for
LIVER COMPLAINTS.
All are more or less affected during the spring
and fall with torpidity of that important organ
of digestion, the Liver. This Bitters, without
containing any preparation of mercury, or by
purging, acts powerfully on this organ, excites
it to a healthy and livelyaction, and gives a
it to a healthy and lively ‘ action, and gives
tone to the whole system; hence	*

Recommendations:
Philadelphia, April 28,1866.Z*.
I consider “Hoofland’s German Bittirs” a
valuable medicine in case of an attack of Indi-
gestion or Dyspepsia. I can certify this from
my experience in it.
Yours, with respect,
JAMES THOMPSON,
Judge of the Supreme Court of Penn’a.
From A. McMakin,' Esq., New York, No. 663
^Broadway, March 29,1866.
Dear Sir—I take great pleasure in testifying
to the extraordinary remedial qualities of the
Hoofland’s German Bitters, procured at your
establishment.
A member of the family has been for many
years a perfect Martyr to Dyspepsia, Palpita-
tion of the Heart, and other distressing off-
spings ol a torpid liver, until persuaded to try
tne above celebrated remedy, which in a few
weeks resulted in making her (to use. her own
words) "a new Woman.”
You are at liberty to make any use of this you
see fit, or refer similar sufferers to
Yours, truly, A. MoMAKIN.
From the Rev. Levi G. Beck, Pastor of the Bap-
tist Church, Pemberton, N. J., formerly of the'
North Baptist Churcn, Philadelphia, at pres-
ent Pastor of the Baptist Church, Chester, Pa.
I have known Hoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably for a number of years. I have used
them in my own family, and have been so
pleased witn their effects that I was induced to
recommend them to many others, and know
that they have operated in a strikingly benefi-
cial manner. I take great pleasure in thus pub-
licly proclaiming this fact4 and calling the at-
tention of those afflicted with the diseases for
which they are recommended, to this Bitters,
knowing from experience that my recommend-
ation will be sustained. I do this more cheer-
fully as Hoofland’s Bitters is intended to benefit
the afflicted, and is not a "rum drink.”
Yours, truly. LEVI G. BEch.
