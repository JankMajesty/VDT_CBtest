An interesting question.
What plass of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those an ected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease than those possessed of strong and
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition? We answer, by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic.
HOOFLAND’S
GERMAN BITTERS,
PREPARED BY
Dr. C. M. JACKSON.
PHILADELPHIA.
- This Bitters is a compound of fluid extracts.
The roots and herbs from which it is made are
gathered in Germany, and their virtues, in the
iorm of extracts, extracted by one of the most
scientific chemits and pharmaceutists this Coun-
try affords. It is
NOT A LIQUOR PREPARATION,
in any sense of the word; contains no whisky,
rum, or any other intoxicating ingredients, and
can be freely used in families without any fear
or risk of those using it contracting the disease
or vicC of intemperance. We wish this fact
distinctly understood, as many others before
the public are prepared from liquor of some kind.
During the
CHOLERA SEASON
of 1849, this Bitters were extensively used
throughout the entire country
A§ A PREVENTIVE,
and we have not heard of a single instance in
w hich this Bitters was used, where the persons
suffered from any of the symptoms of Cholera.

Recommendations:
Philadelphia, April 28,1868 ~
I consider "Hoofland’s German Bitters” a
valuable medicine in case of an attack of Indi-
gestion or Dyspepsia. I can certify this from
my experience in it..
Yours, with respect,
JAMES THOMPSON,
Judge of the Supreme Court of Penn’a.
From A. McMakin, Esq., New York, No. 663
Broadway, March 29,1866.
Dear Sir—I take great pleasure in testifying
to the extraordinary remedial qualities of the
Hoofland’s German Bitters, procured at your
establishment:
A member of the family has been for many
years a perfect Martyr to Dyspepsia, Palpita-
tion of the Heart, and other distressing off-
spings ol a torpid liver, until persuaded to try
the above celebrated remedy, which in a few
weeks resulted in making her (to use her own
words) "a new woman.”
You are at liberty to make any use of this you
see fit, or refer similar sufferers to
Yours, truly, A. McMAKIN.
From the Rev. Levi G. Beck, Pastor of the Bap-
tist Church. Pemberton, N. J., formerly of the
North Baptist Churcn, Philadelphia, at pres-
ent Pastor of the Baptist Church, Chester, Pa.
I have known Hoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably for a number of years. I have used
them in my own family, and have been so
pleased witn their effects that I was induced to
recommend them to many others, and know
that they have operated in a strikingly benefi-
cial manner. I take great pleasure in thus pub-
licly proclaiming this fact, and calling the at-
tention of those afliicted with the diseases for
which they are recommended, to this Bitten,
knowing from experience that my recommend-
ation will be sustained. I do this more cheer-
fully as Hooiland’s Bitters is intended to benefit
the afflicted, and is not a "rum drink.”
Yours, truly, LEVI G. BECK.
