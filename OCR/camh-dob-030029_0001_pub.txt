What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those anected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease than those possessed of strong and
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition? We answer, by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic,

This Bitters is a compound of fluid extracts.
The roots and herbs from which it is made are
gathered in Germany, and their virtues, in the
: orm of extracts, extracted by one of the most
scientificchemits and pharinaceutists this coun-
try affords. It is
NOT A LIQUOR PREPARATION,
in any sense of the word; contains no whisky,
rum. or any other intoxicating ingredients, ana
can be freely used in families without any fear
or risk of those using it contracting the disease
or vice of intemperance. We wish this fact
distinctly understood, as many others before
the public are prepared from liquor of some kind.
During the
CHOLERA SEASON
of 1849. this Bitters were extensively used
throughout the entire country
AS A PREVENTIVE,
and we have not heard of a single instance in
which this.Bitters was used, where the persons
suffered from any of the symptoms of Cholera.

All are more or less affected during the spring

of digestion, the Liver. This Bitters, without
containing any preparation of mercury, or by
purging, acts powerfully on this organ, excites
it to a healthy and lively action, and gives a
tone to the whole system; hence

Politically, the Times will be an unswerving

hearty assistance to every movement calculated

It will still continue tp sustain, fully and
fearlessly, the National Administration in all
I efforts to restore the South to the full exercise
of its undoubted rights in the Union and under
the Constitution of '76.
The large and rapidly increasing circulation
of the Times commends it to the merchants at
home and abroad as
An Advertising Medium of Great Value.
It is printed in large, clear type, on good pa-

Philadelphia, April 28,1866.“
I consider “Hoofland’s. German Bitters" a
valuable medicine in case of an attack of Indi-
gestion or Dyspepsia. I can certify this from
my experience in it.
Fours, with respect,
JAMES THOMPSON,
Judge of the Supreme Court of Penn’a.
From A. McMakin, Esq., New York, No. 663
Breadway, March 29,1866.
Dear Sir—I take great pleasure in testifying
to the extraordinary remedial qualities of the
Hoofland’s German Bitters, procured at your
establishment.
A member of the family has been for many
years a perfect Martyr to Dyspepsia, Palpita-
tion of the Heart, and other distressing off-
spings ol a torpid liver, until persuaded to try
the above celebrated remedy, which in a few
weeks resulted in making her (to use her own
words) "a new woman."
You are at liberty to make any use of this you
see fit, or refer similar sufferers to
Yours, trifly, A. McMAKIN.

I have known Hoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably for a number of years. I have used
them in my own family, and have been so
pleased witn their effects that I was induced to
recommend them to many others, and know
that they have operated in a strikingly benefi-
cial manner. I take great pleasure in th us pub-
licly proclaiming this fact, and calling the at-
tention of those afflicted with the diseases for
which they are recommended, to this Bitters,
knowing from experience that my recommend-
ation will be sustained. I do this more cheer-
fully as Hoofland’s Bitters is intended to benefit
the afflicted, and is not a “rum drink.’’
Yours, truly, LEVI G. BECK.
