Forewarned—Forearmed! should be the mot J
forever in the minds of all subject to CoughJ
Colds, Catarrh, or Influenza. Words of adviefl
should be heeded by all suffering from Asthnufl
Bronchitis,Consumption. Belief is within theifl
reach; and, if neglected,_ fatal consequencefl
ensue—a life of misery—a daily, hourly strugfl
gle for existence. A contest in which th$fl
can be but one victor—Deaths
Does it not appal the strongest mind, to thinfl
of the result caused by neglect? Then why4efl
lay? What excuse can be offered, when timelfl
warning is sounded in your ears? When' thfl
danger is pointed out, why not avoid it? Margil
den’s Pectoral Balm has been used wit|l
success in nearly a million of cases, and is eno
dorsed by the Medical Faculty as the moW
prompt and efficacious remedy that sciential
research has discovered, to relieve and.cure al|l
cases of Coughs, Colds, Influenza, and Consumpl
tion, if the case is not beyond all I hope. Even!
when the sufferer is in the last stages, he will
find relief by using this preparation. One botl
tie will convince the most incredulous, that the!
merits of this preparation are by no means ex-1
aggerated; in fact—falkfar short of the eulogiel
bestowed upon it by thousands who have beeil
cured by its timely use. A guarantee accom-l
ponies each bottle, and dealers are instructed
in every instance to refund the money, when!
this preparation fails to relieve.

NO MORE POVERTY OF THE BLOOD

Dr. Lera's Phosphate of Iron.
This new ferruginous medicine contains the
elements of the blood and bones and iron in a
liquid state. It is different from all hitherto
offered to the public as liquid, colorless and
tasteless. It speedils cures
Chlorois,
Pains in the Stomach,
Difficult Digestion,
Dysmenorrhgsa, Anemia.
The majority of the Academies of Medicine ol

anxiety, nervous emotions, overwork, general
debility and poorness of blood.
It is the only preparation which never causes
constipation, and can be borne by the most deli-

Digestive Lozenges and Powders of the Al\
caline Lactates.
TheAlcaline Lactates exercise the mosfben^
eficial influence over the derangements of diges-
tion, either by their peculiar action on the mu-
cous membrane of the stomach, or by affording
to the latter through their combination with the
saliva to the gastric juice, a supply of Lactic acid,
which all English, French and other physiolo-
f ists, admit to be an essential principle ofdiges-
ion. For the information of those who may be
without medical advice, it may be stated here
that the symptoms of impaired digestion are:
headache, pain in the forehead, hemicrania, gas-
tritis, heartburn, wind in the stomach and bow-
els, loss of appetite, emaciation, etc. All these
soon appear under the action of the Alcaline Lac-
tates, which may be always had in Lozenges or
Powders.	----

MARSDEN’S CAUSA YA TONIC.
As an alterative, it far surpasses any of thel
fictitious preparations with which the country!
is flooded, under the cognotnen of Sarsaparilla, I
Syrups, &c. It is composed of true Calisayal
Bark, in its most concentrated form, combined I
with drugs long and popularly known for their I
virtue in purifying the blood and cleansing it I
from a scrofulous taint. Calisaya Bark has
been long known to the medical profession,
having been introduced by the Jesuits nearly I
two hundred years ago, since which time it has I
been steadily gaining in popular favor, till it is
now recognized as the most reliable tonic and
febrifuge extant. Marsden’s CaHsaya Tonic,
will be found invaluable in all cases of erup-
tions, blotches, pimples, salt rheum, and scor-1
butic affections, neutralizing the effect of hu-
mor in the system, and eradicating all poison
from the blood. In convalescence from febrile
or cutaneous diseases, this preparation can be
used with beneficial effect, as it assists nature
to recover from the the debilitory causes inci-
dent to malarious or malignant fevers.
As an Invigorator in loss of appetite, debility,
dyspepsia, or night sweats, it stands pre-emi-
nent, imparting vitality to the stomach,
assisting the digestive organs to perform their
functions; and imparting life and strength to
the system. The favorable report of thousands
who have been benefited by this preparation
justifies us in offering to all a guarantee that
the merits claimed for this medicine fall far
short of its intrinsic worth to all sufferers from
the above complaints.;

WORDS ADDRESSED TO ALL.
When the system is relaxed by the oppressive
heats of Summer, it becomes more or less pre-
disposed to absorb the poisons arising from re-
fuse and offal with which our cities, abound.
This is one of the prevailing causes of the dis-
eases which are subject to. at this season of the
year, viz: Diarrhea, Dysentery, Cholera, and
last, though not least, looseness of the bowels,
which is a forerunner of these complaints, and
ought, in every instance, be checked. By neg-
lecting the-premonitory symptoms, the bowels
become relaxed to a degree w often termi-
nates in that fatal scourge, Ch The ques-
tion naturally suggests itself, how can we pre-
vent these diseases, and, if suffering, what is
the cure? The grand preventive is cleanliness
and pure air. The cure, Marsdon’s Carminative
Syrup, a preparation composed of Gums and
Barks indigenous to South America, where the
formula has been adopted as being most effica-
cious in all disorders of the bowels.
Marsden’s Carminative Syrup never failing
to relieve and cure every case-of Diarrhea, Dys-
entery and Cholera.
Prepared by T. W. Marsden, 487 Broadway,

CAN CONSUMPTION BE CURED?
This question is so anxiously asked by the
Consumptives, our answer is, that Pulmonary
Consumption, or other diseases of the Lungs,
are as curable as any other diseases if the right
remedies are promptly used. That it can be
cured there is no doubt, as has been repeatedly
and amply proved by autopsies oh thousands of
Itodies of men and women in the Hospitals ot
Europe; these autopsies showing that the cica-
trization of the cavities of the lungs had been
affected during the life of the patient, proving
conclusively that Consumption can be cured!
The next question arises as to the means. On
that subject there exists as great a variety of
opinions as there are practitioners—some advo'-
eating one theory, and some another. It is ad-
mitted by all the Profession, that the discoverer
of any remedy which would generally relieve
and cure Phthisis, Tubercular and Pulmonary
Consumption, would be the greatest benefactor
of the age. The cure has been discovered and
is daily relieving thousands who would other-
wise have been victims of the grave. Pectoral
Balm is the Great Remedy, and fur all diseases
of the Pulmonar Organs stands without an
equal. The Proprietor, confident of the impar-
tial judgment and honor of the Profession, will
cheerfully furnish a bottle of Pectoral Balm to
any respectable Physician, so that a fair trial
can be given of its merits, aud a true report
given. All that is asked is, that the sufferer
from any Bronchial diseases, tries it. and we
are satisfied he will recommend it to all.
