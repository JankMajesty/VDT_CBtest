Admiral Raphael Semmes, is now ed-
itor-in-chief of the Memphis Bulletin.
The bill for the abolition of the Cotton
Tax has been rejected by Congress, by a
vote of 95 to 65.
One hundred and twenty-three prison-
ers of war were shot recently in Mexico,
by order of General Escobedo.
We have noticed no paper beside this
one, except the Augusta Chronicle and
Sentinel, which observed the 22d of Feb'
ruary.
Personal.—Pomeroy, the inevitable
"Brick,” left the city yesterday, for Holly
Springs, en route for New Orleans.—Mem
phis Avalanche, 26th.
The Columbus (Miss.) Index, of the
27 th, says that there are fifty or sixty cases
of small pox among the negroes in that
place.
Surratt insists that he is not Suratt,
"but any other man-” not at all surprise
yng in view of the condition in which he
finds himself.
We regret to learn that Dr. Wm. J.
Leake, of Yazoo City, is dead. He had
been a citizen of that place for more than
twenty years, and was beloved and respect-
ed by all who knew him.
Ex-Gov. Brown, of Georgia, (of mili
tia notoriety,) has written a letter three
columns in length, reviewing the political
situation, and advising the people of Geor-
gia to accept the terms imposed by the bill
recently passed by Congress. We were
not aware before this, that the people had
that privilege afforded them!
On last Saturday evening a skiff com
taining several persons, was capsized in the
river opposite Memphis and five of the
parties were drowned. Their names were,
Mrs. Vance, Mrs. Mangault, W. C Cums
mins, W. Butterworth, and a negro man.
The publishers of the Memphis Bulle-
tin have deposed Col. L. J. Dupre, its late
editor. The following is the resolution :
Resolved, That Colonel L. J. Dupre, in
addressing a letter of the character indican
ted to Attorney General Wallace, under
the circumstances, we regard as an act of
bad faith to his partners and associates,
by which he has forfeited all claim to their
confidence ; and that he be, and is hereby,
removed from his position as editor of the
Bulletin.
Resolved? That the foregoing preamble
and resolution be published in Wednes-
day morning’s Bulletin, and a copy theres
of be presented to Colonel Dupre.
That Burnt Schoolhouse-—A short
time since, we published an extract from a
private letter, from a gentleman iu Col-
umbus, Miss., stating that the freedmen’s
schoolhouse at that place had been acci-
dentally destroyed by fire, and that the
citizens had subscribed the money neces-
sary to build another. In an obscure Rad-
ical paper of New Orleans appears the fol-
lowing paragraph, on the same subject:
"We are glad to learn by a note from
Mr. Willson, Superintendent of the freed-
men’s schools at Columbus, Miss., that
the citirens of that place (that is the better
portion of them) have subscribed some
$1,200, toward building a school-house for
the freedmen, .in place of the one they
burned up, which was worth $5,000. Mr.
’Wilson assures us that many of the citi-
zens really regret the burning of the house,
and. that the teachers have succeeded in
renting a house for a dwelling. In every
community there are those, doubtless, who
regret these acts of violence, but they are
in the minority, and powerless to stay the
hands of the assassin and the incendiary.
The paper from which this is taken pro-
fesses to be a religious journal. It charges
the citizens of Columbus, with having
burned the house which they have sub-
scribed the money to rebuild. Of course,
nobody will believe such a story. Our
correspondent stated that the cause of the
fire was unknown, but that it was sup-
posed that the house had been burned
through carelessness on the part of the
negroes. There are not half a dozen men
in any intelligent Southern community,
who aoprove of the burning of negro
schoolhouses, and this pious Radical sheet
of New Orleans cannot be ignorant of the
fact. And yet it says there is a majority
of such men in every community. Relig-
ious papers should not lie.—[Mobile Ad-
vertiser.

A Wild-Cat Story.—A few days ago
Capt. B. F. Dent, of Bolivar county, sent
his little son about 12 years of age and a
negro boy about the same age, across a
bayou a few hundred yards from the house;
on reaching the bayou, the boys saw. on
the opposite side, an animal that they pro-
nounced a wild-cat, and made good their
retreat back to the house, and informed
Captain Dent of the same. Arming him-
self with a gun he proceeded to the place
indicated, and in attempting to cross the
bayou on a foot log he discovered the cat
approaching him on the log also, and when
within a few feet he fired, but missed the
object of his aim. On his firing, they then
being about the centre of the bayou, the
cat made a spring, alighting On the Cap-
tain’s left shoulder, which it bit and
scratched in a most serious manner, and
otherwise injuring the Captain very severe-
ly. Captain Dent being disarmed, found
nis own safety by plunging into the bayou,
and thus disengaged himself from the cat.
His cries by this time had brought his
dogs to his assistance, and the cat was fi-
nally overcome and killed. Those who
saw it says it was a very large one.
Captain Dent thinks that the man who
boasted "that he could whip his weight in
wild cats,” was never on Jones’ bayou in
Bolivar county, Mississippi.—[Valley Sem |
tinel.	;
That predominant party at the
North who sneer at our honest expres-
sions of sentiment—who impute to
disloyalty that sacred feeling which
induces us to honor and revere a past
full of honor and glory, are much
exercised to know why we are so luke-
warm in support of the "greatest
and best government the world ever
saw." Why our hearts do not swell
with proud emotion as we gaze on that
banner which has been borne in tri-
umph over bloody fields, and which
has given its folds to the breezes of
every land, beneath the blue cope
of heaven ;—that flag which first con-
secrated by the fires of revolution in
’76, has since been the sacred talis-
man of liberty throughout the world.
They seem to forget that we have seen
it baptized in the blood of our bravest
and best,—that through the length and
breadth of our land it has been borne
the symbol of woe and destruction,—
that its glittering stars have gleamed
out amid the lurid light of our burn-
ing homes, and its stripes but reflected
back the ensanguined hue of our soil.
They forget that it was found
powerless to protect innocence and
virtue fleeing from pollution worse
than death, and that where its mission
should have been to save, it swept
forward but to destroy. We are but
human, and we cannot blot out these
recollections. While we remember
that a Grant, McClellan and Macpher-
son marched beneath its folds, we
cannot forget that they also sheltered
a Butler, Turchin, Burbridge, and Mc-
Neal ; and we know that these libels
upon manhood still live, and are rep-
resentatives of the controlling power.
In the eloquent words of another:
"Only when we are a nation of dogs
will such men be forgiven. No, the
man that talks of forgiveness in that
direction has lost the power to distin-
guish between vice and virtue. To
forgive such men, is to be an enemy
to civilization—is to teach our child-
ren that there is no difference between
the friend and the foe of liberty,
dealing with such characters, we
to follow the divine example of
Saviour, when he entered into
Temple, and " overthrew the tables of
the money-changers," and drove them
out, flinging upon them the fierce
denunciation that they were "a den of
thieves." Is it not enough for us to
imitate the Master in dealing with such
characters? Instead, then, of trying
to "accommodate ourselves to the
new state of things," we must rather
think and pray continually how to get
rid of the satanic new, and to get back,
with all possible speed, to the grand
and beautiful old. The old is of
Washington and Jefferson—the new
is of Thad. Stevens and Ben. Butler.
The man who proposes in his heart to
accommodate himself to such a "new
state of things," is a lineal descendent
of those very "thieves" who were
driven out of the Temple by the Sav-
iour. Keep the true history of the
war, with all its abominations, fresh
and flaming before the people, and it
shall not be long before the multitude
will be found hammering the tyrants
on the invisible anvils of millions of
Vulcans. And, in the meantime, what
of the wretch who talks of "accom-
modating?" We say he is a coward
or an apostate! Be the battle-words
of every heart such as these opening
lines of James Barron Hope's "Oath
of Freedom:"
" Born free, thus we resolve to live;
By Heaven, we will be free!
By all the stars which burn on high—
By the green earth, the mighty sea—
By God’s unshaken majesty,
We will be free, or die!”

It is announced in the Northern papers
that the famous Confederate steamer Sum’
ter has been lost in the Polar Sea.
A gang of scoundrels, who have lately
been robbing everybody near Baton Rouge,
were all arrested a few days ago, and
lodged in prison.
The river is reported as falling at St.

TO THE PUBLIC.
The undersigned having presented to the
City Council a design for making a re-survey
and finished map of the City of Vicksburg, and
it having been approved by that body, propose
now to enter upon the work as soon as the list
of subscribers is sufficient to warrant it.
They take this means of informing property
holders, all of whom are supposed to be more
or less interested on the subject, that without
their encouragement, the scheme will have to
be abandoned. It is to be hoped that the impor-
tance of the subject is obvious to ail, and espe-
cially to such as have given it their attention.
Subscription lists may be found at the Levee
Office, corner of Washington and Crawford
streets, and at office of Marshall & Bradford, in
rear of the Law office of Marshall & Miller.
The business men, and all other interested
parties, are called upon to put their names

PASSMAN’S PATENT IE ON TIES
FOR COTTON BALES.
BUCKLE AND BUTTON TIE, United States Patent, April 1865.
THE Hoops are cut to lengths of 10,10X and 11 feet. Ten feet are most generally used, but M
and 11 are sometimes required for large bales. The buckles are fastened to the hoops; the but-
tons will be put up in small boxes. The weight is about Ten Pounds to the Bale of Cotton.
My Button Tie y as the first offered for sale to any extent in the South, and has been used by
thousands of planters with universal approval. I have made a valuable improvement in the
shape of the button since it was first introduced: and have also procured a patent for a BUCKLE
TIE, which, for simplicity, facility and expedition of adjustment to bales of any or of unequal
size, and for security in holding*, is, I think, superior to any offered to the public.
The advantages oi Iron over Rope for baling* Cotton are now universally acknowledged. It holds
the bale in a much smaller compass; is applied and fastened with as much facility, both in the
country pressing* and the recompressing at the sea-ports; lessens immensely the risk from fire;
is strong, and its strength is not impaired by time and exposure as is that of rope. This last ad-
vantage has been strikingly manifested during the war. Thousands of bales of Cotton have been
lost by the rotting* or breaking of Rope, which could have been preserved if Iron hoops had been
used. In addition to this, it can be furnished cheaper than rope. The derangement of labor in
the hemp growing States has reduced the supply of nemp to such an extent as to cause prices to
rule unprecedentedly high; indeed, a sufficiency for baling a moderate cotton crop, cannot be re-
lied on at any price.
I have arranged for the importation of a large quantity of the best English Iron, and have made
arrangements with Messrs. Chambers & Latting for the sale and delivery of my Ties. Fatties
ordering, or desiring farther information on the subject, will please address
& LATTING, No. 61 Carondelet street, New Orleans.
SHIP REFUGE, New Orleans, July 7th, liN.
II. Fassman, Esq., Orleans Cotton Press: Sir—In January last I received from your Press 1869
bales of Cotton, of which about 1000 were compressed and bound with your new “Iron Tie.” lean
safely affirm that the cotton so bound was received in better order than it generally comes from
the Presses; that it stowed better, and enabled the ship to carry more than on any previous voy-
age. The cotton when discharged from the ship in Liverpool, was in better order than the rope
bound cotton. It is highly preferable for a ground tier, as the damp arising from the ballast^
no effect upon it, for it is well-known by practical men that damps will rot the rope bound. lean
confidently recommend yotir “Iron Tie,” as I took this lot for an experiment and carefully watched
it both in loading and discharging. Yours respectfully, JOHN HOWARD, Master.
Certificate of Eire Wardens of the New Orleans Insurance Companies, and of Alfred Be-
lanoer, Esq., etc-Chief Engineer Fire Department:
The undersigned, Fire Warden and Fire Inspector of the New Orleans Insurance Companies,
are of the opinion that the Iron Tie affords greater protection against loss in case of fire than the
old style of baling with rope. J. YOUENNES, Fire Warden : JOHN ADAMS, Fire Inspector
1 concur in the above.	ALFRED BELANGER, ex-Chief Engineer Fire Department.
Samples of the Tie can be seen and orders left at the following named houses in Vicksburg:
J. J. Garrard & Co.; Man love & Hobart; Hazelett & Co.; win. E. Gaunt & Co.; P. Casey;
Shearer L Kern; 3. Hornthal & Co., Smiths & Parsons; W. P< Holloway; Cowan L Herring-

our thanks for the St- Louis Republican,

A most egregious blunder occurred, in
our report of the sale of the Hope, in yes-
terday’s paper. She sold for thirty-five
thousand dollars instead of three thousand
five hundred dollars. ‘ Accidents will
happen, however, in the best regulated
families,” and newspapers too.
The Printers of the Times office re-
turn hearty thanks to Capt. W. M.
Williams for his kind remembrance
of them last night, and will ever
hold him in grateful regard and high
esteem. They hope his tariff will al-
ways keep up, and his wharfboat
never go down. It was unanimously
resolved, "bully for Capt. Williams.”

Theater.—Last night, the "Corsican
Brothers” was put on the stage to a very
good house. It was the occasion of the
benefit of Mr. Oscar Templeton, and the
whole company acted with remarkable vh
vacity.
The same celebrated play will be repea-
ted to night. _
A grand Arabic dramatic company, un>
der the direction of Sidi El Hadj Ali Ben
Mohammed, were to have appeared in
New Orleans last night. They will doubt-
less create a sensation. Wonder if our
friend Templeton, could’nt enter into a
brief engagement with them.
A Washington paper says : There
seems to have been a close race between
the citizens and incendiaries of Atlanta to
determine whether the citizens could build
as fast as the incendiaries could burn.
The same remark is applicable to Vicks-
burg. ____	_________
New Mail Arrangement.—We are
requested by our Postmaste^ to state that
an arrangement has been made, with the
officers of the Southern Railroad, by which
a mail for New Orleans, La., will be for-
warded daily by the accommodation train,
leaving at 2:15 P- M,, whereby the mail
from this city to New Orleans, will be ex-
pedited about 20 hours.
The mail by the accommodation train,
closes daily, at 1:30 p. m. Letters to be
forwarded by it, should be in the post
office, by or before that hour.
OBITUARY.
Another veteran of the "Second War
with England” has passed from earth.
Gerard W. Johnson, a soldier of the
United States Army during the war of
• 1812, died yesterday, Feb. 27th, at the res1
idence of his daughter Mrs. D. W. Cush"
man, in Warren county, at the ripe old
age of 82 years. He was a native, of Ire-
dell county, N. C., but had been a resis
dent of this county for many years past.
During his three years service as a soldier
of earth, he was true and brave—through-
out his long and eventful battle of life he
was no less true ; and let us hope that his
spirit is now victorious "in the bosom of
his Father and his God. ’ ’
