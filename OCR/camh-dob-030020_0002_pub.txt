bility, و٢ will give 0111591٤ the pleasure 0٤
being present.
We welcome ٤0 our exchange list, the
Meridian Gazette, a successor to ٤100 Mes-
senger and Lauderdale Times. We shall
miss our spicy 11004 Grace, and hope that
at some day, he will resume the profession
19 so 1201٢ adorns. Messrs 50000and
Gibson 111 run the Gazette, and they have
our best wishes for 9119985 and prosperity.
Their paper commences with a large cir-
culation and 15 ably conducted.
We have received from Mr. F. j. Dib-
ble. Publisher. 200 Main street, Louisville,
the !0٤ 011000 ا a monthly magazine,
entitled, “Twelve 'Times a Year." 1
point 04 typographical appearance, it is
011٢ equal to 000٢٢ periodical, which 102095
us from the North, while its contents are
varied and judiciously selected. We
heartily commend it as worthy a 110911 and
generous support from the people 0٤ this
seetio.٠٠٠٠٠
“What ought tlie South to do?” is 8
question which will be ol'ten asked 0 some
time 10 come. We hope 1 111 90 dis,
cussed freely, 11 any good 1000 001000 0٤ the
discussion. For our own part, we 210
willing 10 advocate anything which our
reason 201 conscience 000 approve. But
we 010 not 900 anything ٤100ن اه be done,
under the new military bill, 1101098 the
900٤1 is willing to sanction negro suffrage.
Believing, as we 10, that the South 15
conscientiously opposed to negro suffrage,
we 10 10٢٢ 900 امم she can approve 1ا
either as p finality or as a matter of policy.
1و1110ي ا us that if universal negro suf-

be without any signification 0٤ Southern

110 TO 100.11110 Savannah Republi,
can advises as follows:
Now that the 1000 ٤وو fatal blow has
been struck at constitutional liberty 110 the
South, let the people of Georgia and 19
South address themselves to their material
interests 4111 the development of their ma,
terial resources. There is nothing now
that 197 can 10 to promote either ٤0091
own or the general political interests. The
dominant party have determined ٤0 keep
the country unsettled 001 exposed to all
the dangers which attend a people divided
into hostile bodies. Let them take the whole
responsibility and bear the 0019 blame.
We have 090 ready, as a people, for ٤0
years to perform our part 11 the constitu«
tonal s؛ ei, d o discharge ev^ry duty
faithfully and loyally. We have been de-
^ied th p0’ivile٠ge٠0 Let US sunlit wh
whatever of phi؛osopl r and patience we
id to the revolutionary pro,
peedings which we cannot prevent, and
leave the whole responsibility where it
belongs, both for 1100 present evils 2104 for
that future ruin which sooner 0٠ later
overtakes 2 country 1059 government
commits the folly 0ا maintaining a state 0٤
alienation and hostility among 119 several
divisions of the people.

ily, he has been called 1110011 by an ٨11-
189و and we trust, 3 forgiving God, to
penetrate 0101 solve 119 great mystery.
١1٩٢ 1109 prayers following 101111 101٠0-

Capt. 001106 had, in California, 1110

friends, who will deeply sympathize
with 1015 sorrowing relatives 111 1101 1٠
bereavement. Possessed 0٤ extraor-
dinary social traits 0 character, ٤0-

unquestionable integrity, 100100 knew

١Ye give up most of our editorial space
this morning, to articles and extracts from
leading Southern journals, to prove that
we are far 11000 being alone 1 10 position
we have assumed, concerning the “Bayo-
0ام Bill.' 1 From all parts 0٤ 0 State, we
are receiving letters commending 010 views,
and expressing hopes that 10 Convention
111 be called. Advocates of the Conven-
tion, (and seriously speaking, we 00 not
doubt their sincerity,) seem to forget that
10	dominant power desire US 00 مم things
they cannot 00 themselves. .1 order ٤0
carry out their iniquitous schemes, they
abrogate our civil government, 000 substi-
tute a military despotism. This 42800^297
/099٤ 1'،، very nature must be transitory.
11	on the contrary, the people of this State,
11 solemn Convention assembled, accept
the situation, this 0001810111 09 engraft-
ed 1100 the the Constitution, 4911 02099912
law for 071 ،؛'OT،. 119 people 0٤ Missis-
sissippi can take their choice.
The A١vful Brigadier.—The Rich-
mond Dispatch gives the following good
advice:
Let the awful brigadier find us planting
and build ng: whites and blacks Jiving
harmoniously: our Legislature consider،
ing measure؛ lor preserving the credit 0٤
the State 001 developing 1٤5 wealth: judges
01 the 0910101 administering thelaws of the
land ٢٢1٤1 universal acceptation to all 8139:
and then let 111100, 00010 11100 و of و
earth and heaven, 9٢ one order from head-
quarters, deprive a whole people of all this
order, 00109300, and legal protection, and
rule them 1٤1 a bayonet at all their
throats, and 00 law over them but the edge
of ٤19 sword!
We 100اوا ا0م ٢٢ that matters 111
0000 ٤0 this. There may be 50009 consid-
erations (not 0٤law 0[ justice, certainly,)
that 111 stop ٤09 ٤011008 career 0٤ those
!.؛!entlessanarchists. They mayfind, after
٤109٢ have welded together 0191 Sens
bill their Hot 1لز and their ١١'ilson
amendment 10٤0 one trenchant 21001 tre-
mendous tnmahawk ٤0 strike 1110٢٢0 211 و
to utter ruin at one 9000, that after all
there are, perhaps, reasons why the blow
should not be struck. In the meantime
w; cannot, must 00وا abandon our own
cause and the remnant we still possess 0ا
ووم liberties handed 10٢٧0 ٤0 1و from
better times and better men. 000 day the
1010 North 003٢ thank US that by a dig.
11004 passive resistance 0ا the present 01ا
rent of lawless rage ٤19٢9908 اه over the
land ٢٢0 saved those precious liberties from
utter shipwreck: and that in the loudest
and wildest of 00 tempest و did not give
11 110 ship.
Extract ٤٠0100 the oration of 001٠
Thomas w. Harris, 11 honor 0 Gen.
c. 11٠ Mott, delivered in 1101 1٣ Springs,
01 the 221 0٤ February, 1867:

Thus fell 0111٠ lamented brother, his
spirit ٢11001102 11 flight 10 19 401
who gave it, amid the fierce thunders
of the 11011 0٤ carnage 011 blood. 1
speaking 1119 1018111 and simple truth as
10 111119 و and character, we 001010011000
1100011 10110 1119 highest eulogy.
Ardent, though unostentatious in his
friendship, stern and 11111051119 10 the
maintenance 0٤his rights, quicker than
the 112111111098 flash 11 1110 resentment
0؛ wrong and insult, terrible in his ha-
1100 and deadly in 1018 hostility, he 100٢-
ertheless possessed a heart as.tender 311
its emotions 970٠ وه dwelt 110 human
breast. 10 an appeal 0٤ charity 1018

wear the civic wreath. God, in 101و in-
scrutable providence, 19812001 1110 101٠
a soldier, 0111 109 knew 1٤. In the fierce
struggle for the mastery between 00-

truly said, he 100٢91٠ turned his back 010

Underlying 1118 019 nature, there
was a 1990 and abiding sentiment 0٤
reverence and morality, and the 001٣
fear 110 ever experienced, was 10 10
wrong. He anticipated with unwav-

May tliy rest be calm and peaceful,

2 Paris Figaro, 0٤ a recent date says :
All the newspapers ha e said that an
American 001010080 welbknown at 1305-
ton—Mr. 1190010 was engaged 10 setting
م٤ Constitution of the United States ٤0
music. The adaptation has just been given
in public. 11109 performance lasted eight
hours.
Our correspondent gives the following
curious particulars in regard to this strange
music. “The preamble 0 the Constitu'
100 15 a grand and majestic recitative well
sustained by 210 and contrabasso voices.
11م fi'.'st article 1و written ٤0٠ a tenor voice.
Other articles are written, 50100 basso some
%[ soprano, some 10٠ baritone. At the
001 of each 101م the recitative ٥٤ the
preamble 1و taken 110 again in chorus.

10100 0٧ 10 base and 0900 and there
is a struggle of vioces 004 instruments
10 might make 10 author 0٤ Tanin
hauser jealous. The tenor 00 appears
to .sustain the 4002 of Statue rights 38
evidently overcome by the base, whilst the
؟mall flutes which support the tenor wage

the ٤9100٠ 301 1و flutes yield 0 the heav-
10[ instruments, and و0ا return 0٤ 00200 is
celebrated by the violins in slowarapeggio.
The Constitutional Amendment are
treated as fugues, 2111 serve as introduc-
10 to a formidable finale, 10 which the
base drum and the tamtam play impor،
