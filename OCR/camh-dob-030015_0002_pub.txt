VICKSBURG DAILY TIMES.
FRIDAY MORNING, March 8, 1867.
OFFICIAL PAPEE OF THE CITY.
Official Paper of Washington county.
T. B. MANLOVE, HARRY MOSS,
Editors.
|@“For Telegraph see First Page,
The Times styles some of his cotempo-
raries “self-elected.” How else are edi-
tors elected? Who elected him; how
large was the vote, and how great the
. majority?—[Herald.
About the same that beat you, when a
candidate for City Representative.
Our city cotemporary learnt to “keep
cool” during the late wa •' His position
and duties enabled him to maintain his
equilibrium, under the most favorable cir-
cumstances, and habit has now grown to
be a second nature. One or two more
military bills will bring him I elow zero.
The election for Governor, members of
Congress and of the State Legislature,
takes place in New Hampshire on the 2d
Tuesday in March. John G. Sinclair is
the Democratic candidate for Governor.
The Radicals have named General Walter
Harriman lor the same office.
The Panola Star of yesterday says :
“ A very distinct shock of an earth-
quake was felt in this vicinity at three
o’clock last Monday morning. It
awoke many of our citizens, but was
of short duration. In the Southeast-
ern portion of this county and in the
neighborhood of Water Valley and
(Grenada, in Yalobusha county, it was
more violent, and created considera-
ble alarm.”
We do not belong to the rain or the
extermination party. We believe in pro
testing against the great injustice done us
with the strength of reason, which is all
the power we now possess. If we exert
ourselves to get comfort out of desolation,
we may improve our wretched condition;
but even from the most magnanimous con-
querors, obstinacy ’ never exacted a favor.
Let us be cool, calm and considerate. All
is not yet lost. Let us not destroy our
last hope by our own act.—[Herald.
Will Ike be kind enough to inform one
of the uninitiated how he extracts “comfort
from desolation. ’ ’ Probably’ it is the latest
form for extending an invitation to visit
“Brickbat’s.” If not, we’ll keep you on
the extract.
Threatened Suppression of the
Press.—The Nashville Union and Dis-
patch, Oi the 2d, says a telegram to the
Louisville papers of yesterday says that
the Radicals boldly asserted on the streets
on Thursday that Brownlow would sup^
press the Memphis Avalanche on account
of its bitterness towards him and his par-
ty. We can scarcely believe this possible,
because the Governor has conducted him'
self, for the past quarter of a century, the
most bitter and abusive newspaper that
ever existed in Tennessee. If there is
any man in the country who can to erate
that species of opposition it should be r’ne
Governor.
We trust that when the Military Bill is
attempted to be car ied. into effec t in Mis-
sissippi, that Governor Humr,hreys will
disregard it, and t p’peal at o» ce to the 8w
preme Court. Thi.s is his course, and he
will be sustained in it by the people.—
[Times.
We trust that Goy. Iff. will endeavor to
test the matter before the Court, but we
have no idea that he will resist it. To dis'
regard its provi ie, s will simply bring
upon us the very r-vils we are endeavoring
to avert; and cor Jd not possibly benefit us.
Again we say, “-keep cool. ” Let us have
no precipitate or rash action. God knows
the South has suffered enough.—[Herald.
And will suffer still more if the councils
of submissionists are carried into effect.
If Governor Humphreys tests the militiry
bill, he will be compelled to disregard its
provisions, until the decision of Supreme
Court is given.
Years upon years ago, our wisest states-
men indulged in the fond hope that in the
difference of climate, soil, industrial pur-
suits, productions and character of labor,
which marked North and South, lay their
closest bond of union—that these impor-
tant differences, constituted in fact, a coin-
cidence of interest, and that the hostility
of the North against the South, growing
out of ignorance, nursed by a sickly senti-
mentality, and blown into flame by furiou
ana false philanthropy, would soon con-
sume itself, and leave reason and common
sense free to point out, and establish firm-
ly and permanently, our true relations to
each other. That belief passed away
before continued encroachment and op-
pression, a purely sectional party which
embodied itself at the North, increased
year by year; and with each addition to
its strength, grew more bitter and relent-
less. Now it holds its undisputed sway
throughout the land ; plants itself in the
path of the country's progress, challeng-
ing not recognition, but the right to rule.
It holds in iron bonds, the legislative branch
of the government, and not content with
that, is laying its hand upon the executive.
It will soon command, if its progress is
unchecked, the undivided patronage and
distribution of the public monies ; and
while North and South are ground to
earth by taxation, this tax will go to main
tain armies raised to perpetuate its power.
The North, in its insensate hate, is not
only forging our chains, but its own also.
It cannot violate the Constitution to op-
press us, and then rely upon that instru-
ment to protect' itself.
The truth is, this government is rapidly
being merged into a military despotism,
and three years from hence, its chains will
hang as heavily upon the North, as they
now do upon us. We are told, that for
the present, at least, our doom is sealed.
That it is our clearly defined policy to
“keep cool,” and give no expression to our
real feelings. Prudence may dictate such
a course, but true honor and manhood re
volt from it. The dominant party are cari
tying out their schemes on the presump-
tion that we are rebels and traitors. No
action, nor abject humiliation on our part,
can induce them to alter their programme
in the slightest degree. Then, why crouch
like the hound to meet its punishment. A
people united as ours are in a common
bond of long suffering and sorrow, are not
powerless so long as the love of liberty
lives in their hearts. Years may pass
away, before we can rend our chains ; but
the time will come, and with it, the men
who dare to strike for freedom. We do
not profess to belong to the Ruin and Des-
truction party, ’put we love the South, and
we would rat’aer sec it blotted from exist-
ence, than render willing allegiance to those
who seek to make us felons and slaves. We
counsel no resistance; for the cross, which
we sc, often followed to victory is laid away,
and. its gallant defenders are scattered and
gone. Some alas! are lying stark and cold
amid the valleys of far off Virginia—
others have crimsoned with their life’s
blood, the craggy steeps of the land of
Oglethorpe and Troupe; while many
have returned to their desolate homes, to
assume the quiet but responsible duties of
citizenship.
Our future—who can compass it ? What
prophet's eye can pierce the veil ? This
much we know: should distraction, vacilla-
tion or weakness prevail—should the
South draw her counsel from undecided
sources, then her destiny is dark. If
united counsels wisely governing, shall
plant her on her few remaining rights,
and maintain her there with the calmness
of firm conviction, she may fall, but with
her duty done.
Nero Tuning his Fiddle.

will be cut. We shall nerve ourselves for the
prospect, and try to stand it without tears.
For proof of what we say, hear how Nero
is tuning his'fiddle. Charges are made on
eofflns, net only by undertakers, but by em-
bryo Pachas. Fiendish laughter, and demon-
like howls of triumph are heard in the halls
of Congre is, in accompaniment to the sounds
of the bell that trills the funeral of the con-
stitution; rather the last shred of that instru-
ment,which is to be buried out of sight under
the bill that consigned ten provinces, whilom
independent States, to the government of ir-
responsible satraps.
Roll on good ball of revolution; tune your
fiddle, beloved Nero, and keep
“Time, time, time.
To the wrangling and the jangling of
the bells.”
The fire bells, whose peals will bring to-
gether, not firemen, but incendiaries.
[Mobile Tribune.
[Special Correspondence of the Baltimore Ga-
zette.)
Washington., February 24, 1867.
The overshadowing iniquity of the
“military .bill” as it finally’ passed
Congres s, has obscured many of the
subsequent enormities already acted
upon, o.i? in embryo in that body. A
bill, to which I some time ago refer-
red, reported by the Judiciary Com-
mittee, was passed by the Hou e last
night' by a strict party vote. It not
only iiiilemnifies every Federal officer,
military' or civil, against responsibility
for all the outrages, robberies, and
cruelties, of whatever character, per-
petrated during or since the war, but
stops the execution of the judgment
of the Supreme Court in respect to
military tribunals. In reply to a
question by Mr. Cooper, of Tennessee,
Mr. Wilson, chairman of the commit-
tee, distinctly declared that the bill
would prohibit civil courts from re-
viewing the proceedings of military
courts in the past, and that it was in-
tended to prevent just such action as
the Supreme Court had taken in the
Milligan case. The other decision of
the Court—that in reference to the
test-oath—appears to be disregarded
on all sides; so it may' be set down as
settled that the judicial branch of the
Government has been substantially
overthrown, not only as a co-ordinate
and independent department of the
Government, but as an expounder of
ordinary law. The bill alluded to will
doubtless receive the sanction of the
Se«i ate.
A bill repudiating debts due by the
Government to Southern -men who
sided with the Confederacy, has been
passed by’ both houses. The injustice
of this measure will be ipore apparent
when it is considered that such parties
are held to a rigid account for even
constructive liabilities. Indebtedness
to the Post Office Department for
stamps, envelopes, etc., which under
the circumstances were of no possible
value to any one, and which in noway
took a dollar out of the public treas-
ury, is set up and payment enforced
even where the parties are dead and
their estates insolvent, by the unlaw-
ful withdrawal of mail facilities, so
that the money may be wrung from
entirely innocent people.
Many other acts of similar charac-
ter have either already been passed or
are upon the tapis. I hear of a bill
which has been prepared providing
for extensive confiscations of Southern
landed estates. The idea that the
“ military bill” is the crowning enor-
mity, that it contains the ultimatum
of the Radicals, that it is intended as
a final." ty, is openly derided by all
prominent members of the dominant
party. They say they have applied
the “ entering wedge”—their ultimate
design is to seize upon every inch of
Southern soil. I understand that the
confiscation bill I have alluded to was
seen by Mr. Johnson, your Senator,
and that this knowledge of the exis-
tence of such a project is alleged by
him in palliation of his vote upon the
military bill. It must be obvious,
however, that submission to the out-
rageous demands already made is a
very ineffectual way of preventing
further enormities.

The National Intelligencer says :
It is affirmed in defense of the mili-
tary bill that it is but temporary in its
operation, and is intended to be pre-
paratory to civil government. But
the authority to suspend even tem-
porarily the constitutional rights of
any portion of the people implies the
power to alienate them altogether.
Are our liberties, guaranteed as they
are by the Constitution, to be held by
the permit of a Congress ? If Con-
gress can subject ten citizens to mili-
tary domination, it can subject the
whole nation, and that people is on
the road to despotism which will
tamely submit to the arbitrary gov-
ernment of any portion of its citizens.
The Sherman Iniquity.—“If the
Southern people should resist the exe-
cution of martial law by force, they
would be fighting in as righteous a
cause as any in which a patriot ever
drew his sword. Armed resistance is
the natural and appropriate mode of
redress for such flagrant injustice as
is now meditated against the South.
‘ Resistance to tyrants is obedience to
God.’ The only good reason for not
appealing to arms in this conjuncture
is the hopelessness of success.” ’—[N.
V. World.
That’s all true, and very well and
bravely spoken. But the principles
of this measure, despotic in theory
and practice, affect the people of the
North, and pave the way to their en-
slavement. What do the friends of
freedom in that section say ? A sub-
sequent number of the World answers
the question when it advises the
Southern people to accept what it
deems the objectionable parts of the
bill, for the sake of the good which it
thinks they may be able to work out
of it—[Clarion.
A new way of celebrating St. Val-
entine’s Day has been tried in New
York. The leading idea is that each
one.invited to a social entertainment
shall contribute one or more valentines
written for the occasion, and addressed
to parties on the invitation list. These
valentines are to be read by selected
ladies and gentlemen for the amuse-
ment and edification of the company.
We believe in destiny—in an invisible Pow-
er that shapes the course of human events,
using men themselves as the instruments, and
withdrawing them when they begin to cut too
deep. The royal dragoon who mortally
wounded John Hampden, passed the decree
by which Charles I. lost his head. The genius
influence and honesty of Hampden would
have held back the arm of Cromwell—would
have preserved the monarchy. But English
society needed a more thorough subsoiling
than it would have received with the hands
of Hampel n on the plow handle. He was re-
moved, and the way cleared for Cromwell.—
Here was a plowman that plowed deep, and
moistened his land with the blood of a King.
No one man did more than Mirabeau to-
wards starting the ball of the French revolu-
tion. He was the great hunter that called up
from their loathsome kennels the ravenous
curs Robespienre, Marat and St. Just, and the
blood-hound Danton. He was taking meas-
ures to beat back the clamorous pack, when
death’s hand was laid upon him. His alloted
task was done. He had pointed out the game
and started the pack. His gianthand was not
needed for rolling forward the guillotine and
slaugtering victims during the reign of terror.
Nor was it his allotted task to rebui d the
edifice for the destruction of which he had
taken a contract from the Almighty. The
man that was to do that work—that" was to
reunite the broken fragments—to call order
out of chaos—to divide the dry land from the
sea—that man was then a strippling, un-
known to fame, but the guns were already
east, which, under bis guidance, were des-
tined to thunder at the gates of every capital
of continental Europe and—to enter them.
It may seem preposterous to compare the
late Abraham Lincoln with such men as
Hampden and Mirabeau. And we have no
intention of doing any such thing. Still, we
have seen cocoa-nuts’ gathered, not only by
men, but by monkeys.
The power that was placed in the hands of
Mr. Abraham Lincoln at the beginning of the
present revolution, as fodder is placed in the
rack of a jackass—without any effort on the
part of the ass—such power in such hands,
was greater than any ever wielded by Hamp-
den or Mirabeau. And but for the pistol of
Booth. Mr. Lincoln would have ruled the
present revolution. We believe ho would
have seen, or others would have seen for him,
that his interest lay in consolidating his pow-
er, and not in prosecuting further the work
of disintegration. He would have out-John-
soned Johnson in opposition to Congress, and
with far more effect. He would have wrap-
ped his long legs around those of the Presi-
dential ehair and held on with the' grasp of a
twenty foot tape-worm. But this man was
removed by Divine Providence, as Hampden
and Mirabeau were removed before him. lie
was removed because his big foot was in the
way of the revolutionary snow-fall that he
thought was big enough." but the Almighty
differed with him, and put him out of the
way, with Booth nd his pistol as instruments.
The attempts of Mr. Johnson to stop the
present revolution will be as futile as w^is
that of Dumouriez to pull rein on the revolu-
tion in France. Mark our words, it w ill roll
on till chair of President and bench of Su-
preme Judge are swept away into outer dark-
ness. Society at the North needs the laneet,
and the Divine Doctor will not fail to admin-
ister it. And it may be that the patient will
writhe so under the operation that his artery

Woodruff & Diseeens have scut
us the “Land We Love;” New York
Clipper and Police Gazette.
The Circus. In spite or the mud,
which proved a considerable drawback,
the attendance at the Circus, last night,
was very good; and the managers pro-
duced a number of acts, which prove their
company to be a most excellent one. The
tight-rope performance attracted our es-
pecial attention, while the “stilt” act
proved most mirth provoking. Let every
one visit the Circus to-night.
The March number of the “Land We
Love’ ’ has been laid on our table by Wood-
raff & Diserens- The articles, both prose
and poetry, are more than up to the ordi-
nary standard, and many anecdotes and
incidents of the late civil war are stored
in its pages, which will furnish material
for future historians. The atmosphere of
the South, though favorable to the growth
of some of the most distinguished authors
of America; has been unpropitious to the
success of Southern magazines. We hope
that “The Laud We Love” may be an
exception. It certainly deserves success.
Will her countrymen and countrywomen
respond to the e'oquent appeal made to
them by Miss E. B. Cheesborough, in the
number before us ?
“If the South ever expects to build up
a literature of her own, she must encour-
age her own writers and patroniz j her own
publications. There is genius enthroned
in majesty on the wide brow of the South,
if we would only see it. Let us not do a,
we have done—freeze up the flowings of
the stream of Southern literature by our
coldness, apathy, and neglect. We have
established a name for military genius of
which we may well feel proud; let us now
bring our white stones, and erect an im>
mortal temple to Southern literature. We
have seen that there is genius among the
women of the South, and we know that
there is among her men; and all that
Southern genius asks is, that its own peo-
ple would lay their hands upon its head,
in a loving benediction.”

The Louisville. Courier of Tuesday,
gives the subjoined account of the stage of
water in the upper rivers :
“The river was falling slowly yesterday,
barely 4 inches in 24 hours, at the head of
the falls, and not over 6 inches at Port-
land, with nearly 50 feet water in the
channel, and fully 25 feet water on the
falls, which is rather more than requisite
for either navigable or mercantile purposes.
The weather has been as changeable and
variable as ever was known in March With
however, only a few minutes sunshine but
abundance of clouds and rain, a dash of
hail, and quite a snowstorm.
The expected blustering, roaring 1st of
March came on the 2d, though less bois-
terous than generally expected with the,
advent of spring. We, however, may
consider it a precursor of the season and
can anticipate mild weather at the close of
the month, and not much danger or fear
of any more hard winter.
The river at Cincinnati was falling slowly
Saturday, with much wet and disagreeable
w.eather, and but a moderate amount of
business doing.
The river at Pittsburg was also falling,
though a rise was anticipated in that
quarter.
As we stated Saturday, au immense
aitnount of rain would have to fall and
more than ordinary rises occur in the up-
per tributaries to keep the river at its
present stage, much less to cause it to rise-
Our view of the case was correct, and we
are glad it not only relieved the apprehen1
sions of the dwellers along the margin of
the waters, but as the river actually re-
cedes it was substantiated as true, and no
further fears of inundation are, for the
present, entertained.
The flood-tide continues to prevail
along the Lower Ohio, and in some
localities the river is over its banks,
and immense damage has ensued.
The Cumberland river is now at a
very high stage, and was rising- fast at
Nashville Saturday, and the most dis-
astrous consequences are apprehended,
as the Ohio from Uniontown to Cairo
is fully as high as the waters of the
great flood of 1847. We can see but
little hope for Cairo, as the level of
the waters is now fu.r above the high-
est natural point of ground in that
city. Its only protaction is the em-
bankment thrown up and known as
the levee. A break in that would
cause immense damage.
The February IRun of Coal_____The
lato run of coal ^vas very light, and
we understand that at present there is
but very little coal “ got out” of the
Monongahela mines, or ready for ship-
ment. The amount in the ports during
the past month was very limited, and
that supply is now exhausted.
The only sales we have heard of
were 200,000 bushels afloat, to Captain
Packer, for Natchez, at 12 cents in
barges, and sixteen cents in boats, in-
cluding boats; the barges to be re-
turned.—[Ibid.
