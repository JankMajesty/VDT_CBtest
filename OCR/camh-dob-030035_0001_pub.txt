From the Rev. Levi G. Beck, Pastor of the Bap-

North Baptist Churcn, Philadelphia, at pres-
ent Pastor of the Baptist Church, Chester, Pa.
I have known Hoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably, for a number of years. I hate, used
thdm in my own family,- and hav^b'een so
pleased with their effects that I was induced to
recommend them to many others, and know
that they have operated ip a strikingly benefi-
cial manner. , I take great pleasure in thus pub-
licly proc j aiming this fact^ and calling the a1>
tention of those affiicted with the diseases for
which they are recommended, to this Bitter^,
knowing from experience that jny recommend-
ation will be sustained. I do this more cheer-
fully as Hoofland’s Bitters is intended to benefit
the aflneted, and is ijot a “rum drink.”
Yours, truly, , . LEVI G. BECK*
