Our patrons .must excuse the type

past few days. Accidents will occur, &e.
If Gen. Lee is “going with the Her-
ald,” ho is, for once in his life, travel-
ing the wrong way, in the very worst

There is such a pressure upon our
columns at present, that we trust our
readers will excuse the scarcity of
leaded matter. The “Military Bill”
renders it ticklish to discuss politics.
The doings of the great Father of Wa-
ters requires additional space, in order
that its erratic movements may be ac-
curately chronicled. The races are the
order of the day in Mobile, and the
“green” is fioating to the breeze in Ire-
land. Brownlow and Stevens are both
sick, and Congress adjourns at an ear-
ly day. We are compelled to an-
nounce these facts, hence when they
are clipped and placed in order, our
columns are filled with fearfully solid
matter. Thus it happens that we have
no leader this morning.
The First Gun.—As will be seen by
the following, which appeared in the eve-
uing Picayune of 27th, Gen. Sheridan has
displaced from office the Mayor of New
Orleans, the Attorney General of the State
and the Judge of the First District Court: [
HDQ’RS FIFTH MILITARY DIST.1

Geo. L. Hartsuff, A. A. G.
THAT staunch old sheet, the Louis
ville Courier, warns the Southern
States against the attempts now mad<
to inveigle them into an adoption o
the late Congressional plan of recon
struction. We have not time, nor is i
> necessary, to look at the details of th<
bill. No inference can be had of wha
’ will follow the adoption of the meas
are. There is no promise that the rev
, olutiou shall cease; none that the
. States will be admitted; none tha
military law will be lifted from the
people, or that property will not bt
confiscated,or drumhead courts martia
will not be convened to harrass and
drive to despair a people already or
the verge of desperation from pover-
ty, starvation and uncertainty. But
take it for granted that the functions
of the State governments arc restored,
and representatives are admitted from
them to Congress—what then ? Is it
not obvious that collisions between
the white and black voters will take
place at every ballot-box ?
Is it not equally plain that bayonets
will nlav their part in the new role,
and aggravate lire-----
And what next? More soldiers,more
bayonets, more anarchy, and less liber-
ty. But what next? The rural dis-
tricts will be deserted. The negro
will not work and vote; but he will
take from his defenseless white neigh-
bor, who has no protection, all he may
raise, and compel him to find a home
in the cities and villages as a means of
relief from exaction and robbery.—
And what next? He will suffer
for food until driven by inexorable
necessity to robbery and plunder him-
self. Human nature is at last human
nature, nothing more. Under good
government, good laws, protection to
labor and its rewards, men will pay
debts, live well, be neighborly and
kind, and love the government that
protects him. Under a bad and op-
pressive system of laws, administered
by drunken satraps, whose will is law,
the country can make no advance, be-
cause there is no security to property,
life, or liberty. What then? Anarchy.
What next? Empire.
Suppose the South does not accept!
the late legislation of Congress. Con- >
gress will force its policy upon them ; '
but then there will be a chance, when [
the nation gets sober, to right up and I
go on again. But if the people of the j
several States meet in convention and
make their constitutions conform to
the act of Congress, the last link will
be broken. They cannot take the back
track. The doom of liberty is sealed
forever.
Every army officer expects to be an
Emperor or hold some place in the
Empire, not of free States moving for-
ward to greatness, but slave provinces,
ground down and oppressed, forever-
more. We sav to them, pause.

Colored Meeting in Savannah.—
A meeting of the colored people’ of
Savannah was held on the 18th. Mr.
Porter, colored, warned them :
Against placing confidence in un-
worthy candidates for their suffrages,
and in order to do this, they must be
as wise as serpents and as harmless as
doves; for when the fishes and loaves
are to be dispensed, false friends will
arise, calculated to deceive even the
elect. He was for universal suffrage,
which, like the blessings of Heaven,
were free to all without distinction of
race, color, or circumstances in life.
Rev. T. G. Campbell held out a glor-
ious future'for the whole human fam-
He also warned them to make quali-
fication and not prejudice the measure
of confidence, proving loyalty, not by
words, but by actions. He asked for
the right of sitting in the jury box,
saying that the white people grumble
at the performance of jury duty. We
will not refuse to do this or any other
devolving upon us in our character as
American citizens.
Many other speeches followed from
whites and colored, and resolutions
“accepting the situation” were adopt-
ee.
V^rom the Mobile Register.
MOBILE YVACES.
There are two kinds of bankruptcy
contemplated by the recent bill, voluntary
and involuntary. In the former any per'
son owing over §300, and finding himself
insolvent, may apply by petition to the
judge of the district in which he has re-
sided for the six months preceding the
date of petition or for the longest peiiod
during six months, and shall thereupon be
declared a bankrupt. The creditors hav-
ing been notified by the Court, meet to-
gether and appoint one or more assignees
of the estate of the debtor. The whole
affairs of the bankrupt pass into the hands
of the assignees, who have full power to
close the estate.
Acts of involuntary bankruptcy, depar-
ture or absence from the State where debts
are owed with intent to defraud the crcdi'
tors, concealment to avoid service of pro'
cess for the recovery of the debt, conceal-
ment of property to avoid seizure or legal
proceedings; assignment destined to de-
fraud or delay or hinder creditors ; arrest
and detention for seven days under exe>
cution for a debt exceeding one hundred
dollars. In involuntary bankruptcy the
conditions are made more stringent than
in the others. The penalty for any fraud
or concealment, direct or indirect, under
the act, is imprisonment, with or without
hard labor, for a term not exceeding three
years.
[Special to the New Orleans Times.
Washington, .March 26.—The Senat<
was occupied all day discussing the ad-
journment question. The Judiciary Com
mittee reported against the House propos
ition for an intermittent session. After i
debate which lasted until night, a resolu
tion was adopted to adjourn on Thursday
next till the first Monday in December.—
The House will agree to-morrow to adjourn
until November- The Senate will proba'
bly agree to this.
The Senate Finance Committee have un-
animously agreed to report adversely to the
cStifirmation of the Hon. Frank P. Blair,
as Minister to Austria.
Smythe, the Collector of New York, was
before the Senate Judiciary Committee to'
day. He made a long statement which
j completely vindicates Senators Patterson
■ and Doolittle from the charges against
i them in connection with the New York
! Customhouse. The committee will make
! a report exculpating the Senators named
I from all charges.	SCRIBE.
: Washington, March 26.—Senate.—
! Howe reported from the Committee on
Claims a joint resolution relative to the
claims of certain Northern creditors.
The joint resolution as amended provides
for the appointment by the Secretary of
the Treasury of three Commissioners, one
of whoa. hn learned in the law, to take
evidence and report u, ■	.u ^,1
lvjixvc ou-ppvitiug claims to tunas remain’*
ing on deposit with the Citizens’ Bank of
New Orleans to the credit of the Confed-
erate States. The commissioners shall
give notice of the time and place of the
investigation by advertisement in New
York, Boston, Philidclphia and New On
leans papers tor three months. The cost
of the commission shall come out of the
fund, and no claim shall be considered un-
less presented within the three months.
Passed.
The bill withholding agricultural college
I scrip from the Southern States, until top-
1 resented, passed. It goes to the President.
A bill fixing the day upon which the
bankrupt bill shall take effect, was referred
to the Judiciary Committee.
Various adjournment propositions were
discussed. Finally a resolution that both
Houses adjourn on Thursday, passed.
House—A resolution ordering a survey
fbr a ship canal around the falls of thr
Ohio at Louisville, passed.
Butler and Bingham, in personal
Slanations assailed each other furiously.
. utler said he had examined the evirtepce
in the trial of the assassination coripira'
tors for another purpose than that o prov-
ing Mrs- Suratt’s unjustifiable tanging,
He said the memorandum book in which
Booth kept, day by day, his thoughts,
plans, and motives, was taken from his
dead body and withheld, though his pipe,
spurs and knife, were presented :.n court.
This memorandum book was in possession
of the Judiciary Committee, with eighteen
pages of entries, made prior to Lincoln’s
assassination, cut out, He wanted to krow
if that book was complete when it fell into
the hands of the Government, and why
the diary was withheld from court. He i
does not charge the gallant soldiers who sat I
in that court with any wrong. They did
not see the diary, or they would have
judged differently. Who spoliated that
book ? Who suppressed that evidence?!
Who caused that innocent woman to be
hanged? There are still in the diary
words written a few hours before Booth’s
death. Butler quoted from memory: “I
have endeavored to cross the Potomac five
times, and failed. I propose to return to
Washington, give myself up, and clear
myself from the great crime.’' Butler
continued, “Why was not Col. Conger ah
lowed to tell what was found on Booth’s
body?’’ He believed the diary would
show that up to a certain hour Booth had
intended to abduct Lincoln.
SATURDAY—FIRST DAY.
The weather was delightful, and the
track in excellent order. The attendance I
was not as large as might have been ex*
pected, but, nevertheless, a great many
gentlemen and a goodly number of ladies
were present to witness the inauguration
day of t he spring races.
The first race was for the plate stake,
and the only horses coming to time were
Alexander’s Alhambra and Cottrill’s Jen’
ny C. The two heats were won in pre’
eisely the same distance in coming under
the string, by Jenny C., which was several
lengths ahead, and in the two heats around
the course, Jenny C._ maintained her lead
by three lengths, easily.
' Mr. Cottrill therefore holds the chal-
lenge plate until it is taken from him by
Ml . Alexander, or other competitors. It
Was quite evident that Jenny C. was an
easier winner of the stake, and it now lays
over to next fall to be decided between the
two winners.
The time in the first heat was 1:49F
The second heat 1:51' . The two heats
were one easily by Jennie C., by three
lengths.
SECOND RACE.
In this race, the only two horses pre-
sented were Lancaster and Stonewall Jack-
son, two of the noted racers of the country.
Lancaster had the call in the pools and
outside betting, up to the start, by mate- i
rial odds. In the toss for places, Jackson
got the (rack, and after a fairstart, he took i
the lead and kept it to the string by several
lengths in each heat. Lancaster made i
several brushes on the Stonewall, but could j
Dot reach him, and the invincible Stone- j
■wall only widened the gap at his approach, ;
Doming in an easy winner over the high I
spirited and fleet footed Lancaster. The
distance between the horses was only one 1
length in the last mile, coming under the |
string. Time 3:50,
The Shreveport Southwestern, of
the 20th, thus reckons the receipts of
cotton at that place :
The warehouse receipts of cotton at
this place, since the 1st September up
to last night, were 40,395 bales. From
tile Boot irufnriYiatioxi wc oan gather
there are still some 10,000 bales in the
interior to come forward. Our esti-
mate at the commencement of the sea-
son was from 40,000 to 50,000 bales.—
The estimated shipments from Old
River for the same time are 6000 bales.
According to the report of the Super-
intendent of the Kouns Canal, 9432
have passed through the canal from
Upper Red River since the 17th No-
vember. The shipments from the up-
per river will reach upwards of 10,000
bales. We have but little data upon
which to base an estimate of the cot-
ton shipped from Jefferson. Up to the
I 1st of January the shipments amount-
t ed to 12,000 bales. Since that time it
is safe to estimate that they have ship-
| ped 8000 more. If our estimates are
I correct we have shipped from this place
and points above here 75,827 bales of
! cotton since the 1st September. We
i have 2000 bales on hand included in
[ the above.
The 1’ieayunc of day before yesterday,
says an attempt by the brokers to discredit
city money, caused considerable excite-
ment there.
We notice that it is sometimes difficult
to use them up here, but can't see the
reason, as they seemed to pass very cur-
rently in New Orleans a few days since.
Meerschaum, similar in appearance
to that found in Europe, has been dis-
covered iu franklin county. Missouri.
Diiigiiaixi replies exciueaiy. Hnct wa>
called to order for using the word “disre-
putable.’' He claimed that words writter
after the act were inadmissible as evidence
He denied all knowledge of the spoliatior
of the diary, and disavowed all responsi'
bility for the conduct of the prosecution.
He denied that he had withheld ani
portion of the testimony. The only evi-
dence withheld was that which came ui
after the fact, and all lawyers know that
could not be admitted in any court. Al:
! concluded that such evidence was inadmis
: sable, but perhaps theirs was not equal t<
! the unconquerable genius of the uncon
i querable hero of Fort Fisher. The gen-
tleman could not produce the diary, and
Mr. Bingham did not care anything about
it He had never seen it. He challenged
his opponent to produce the evidence, and
when produced, it would not be of a char*
actor to convince any one except, perhaps,
one who had lived in a bottle, or was fed
with a spoon. In conclusion, Bingham
again denied that he had withheld anj
portion of the testimony, or had dealt, in
any particular, in an unjust manner upon
the trial. He was not the organ of the
court, nor was it his duty to bring the tes-
timony referred to before the court. The
plan to kidnap the President was all in the
evidence, and was completely investigated.
He had never had the diary in his posses-
sion. He denied most emphatically that
he had mutilated or permitted the mutila1
tion of any of the testimony. The whole
charge was false, corrupt and malicious,
and for the truth of what he uttered he
was willing to be judged by Him who
would eventually judge all, and would hold
them to an account for the deeds of this
day.
Mr. Butler endeavored to obtain a fur-
ther hearing, but it was refused, and a
resolution of Mr. Wood, (of New York,)
to investigate the subject, was rejected by
a very decisive vote.

apprehensions of further trooble.
Washington, March 26 —B. F. DeBow
died at Elizabeth, N. J., yesterday. He
was business manager of DeBow’s Review.
His brother, its editor, died recently at
the same place.
Southwest Pass, March 26.—On the
18th day of January, 1867, two Eng-
lish steamers, one Breijien ship, a Brit-
ish ship, an American ship, one Amer-
ican steameij all lying on the South-
i west Pass Baio completely blockad-
ed the channes to entirely suspend
all inward anmtward bound move-
ments, and toirtually close the port
of New Orlen, and seal ourmercan-
, tile marine tre for over a month.—
At this date tre were 21 vessels and
a 60,204 bales oiotton, to say nothing
, of other merandise lying idle at that
'■? place. The ct to commerce for this
. delay can onlbe estimated by giving
j a statement ofigures. We have made
, an approximion of the cost of this
blockade, aidre perhaps not far out
- of the wayimur figures.
> The vaiie of the vessels detained
, was say S210),000, and allowing inter-
est on thi.ssun at 25 per cent, per an-
3 num, show n loss of §43,750 for the
. month, lie value of the cotton alone
i at £25 periale, with exchange at 140,
i shows tha§9,364,832 20 was also ly-
; ing idle, te interest of which at 8 per
cent, per unum, is §62,432 21. Pay
s of officer and crew with provision
bill, was 28,625 more. Extra towage,
say 825,00. Thus, without going in-
to minor details of broken hawsers,
vessels elated and other damage, this
one blo'kaue cost commerce §159,807
21. TV this we should add extra coal
consuned !>y the steamers and tugs.—
Allowmg we have three of these
blockades in a season, or a year. ’♦
would cost about a half Mjshtest re-
lars, and that with"”* W^test ,c
tUTh^<?L-t-iCavfttor is yet an untried
and it behooves the Govern-
, me nt to prepare without delay the ne-
jeessary appliances to keep the bar open
at all times. With proper and judi-
cious management this may be done
at a comparative small cost.
Among the first duties of the proper
iauthorities is the removal of the
i wrecks on the bar. A submarine di-
' ver and a few kegs of powder would
I do the work- The Government has
[several torpedo boats—send one of
I them down here.
It is but a few days since one of the
regular trading steamers struck the
I wrecks, and §25,000 will scarcely pay
ler bill of damages. Scarcely a week
[passes but a vessel or two strike the
'wrecks.- We ask the merchants of
New York, Boston or Philadelphia
what they would do if their harbors
were thus neglected—and we can an-
swer for them. Their chambers of
commerce would visit Washington,
and they would not be silent till some-
thing was done for them.
Our levee system is also at fault.—
Look at Holland! see her dykes! She
is a lowland country, but see how she
keeps up her soil and enables her peo-
ple to dwell in security, though the
ocean surges several feet above her
lands. Are we to live so far behind
the Dutchmen?
We throw out these suggestions,
trusting that something may be done,
and that quickly, to remove all cause
of complaint in relation to our bar.—
The lighthouse board, iu reply to this
correspondent, promises to keep the
bar buoyed if we will notify tne In-
spector, This we will do as often as
may be necessary.
We are looking forward to the time
when vessels will have no trouble at
our bar and trust it is not far distant.
But we cannot yet see the promise of
the dawn of that happy day.

NEW ORLEANS TIMES OFFICE.
Monday Evening, March, 26, 1867.
Cotton—There was little activity in the
market to-day. There was plenty of or-
ders, but mostly limited to rates which
factors would not accept: Sales, therefore,
only reached half of the amount reported
yesterday, 2500 bales being all we could
find sold, and at rates about the same as
paid yesterday. The demand continues
for the higher in preference to the lower
grades, while there is more of the latter
quality on the market, as is likely to be
the case with but the winding up of the
season’s crop coming forward—the scat*
tercd driblets of a wide section of country.
Wo therefore renew quotations, viz. : 26}
@27c. for ordinary, 27}@28c. for good
ordinary, 27@29}c. for low middling, and

VICKSBURG TIMES, FRIDAY, MARCH 29, 1867.

THE Equescutheatron.—We were stir j
prised last evening, upon entering the
spacious pavillion of Haight & Chambers’ !
Equescut’ Cron,to find so many in attend-
ance, as they were one day in advance of
their time. We were also very agreeably *
surprised to see the manner in which the
performance was conducted. The first
feature that attracted our attention, was
the Horizontal Bar, by the invincible
Miacco Brothers, the renowned Sam Rine-
hart, and Harry Bernard, the dauntless
champion. Mr. Wm. Naylor then enliv^
ened the audience in his daring bave-back
act, which is only equaled by his dashing
hurdle race. Mr. N. is the young chain*
pion of America, and too much credit can
not be done him for the artistic manner
with which he appeared in his particular
roles. The leaping act was beyond com*
petition. We noticed with pleasure the
smiling countenance of the young Ameri-
can champion, with whom we were for-
merly acquainted, Sam Rinehart. The
act was in to to one of credit to the com-
pany- We found Sam “still there” in his
double somersault, in which he has justly
won the command of the championship of
America. The feature of particular in-
terest to us was the truly astonishing act
of juggling on horseback, by Sig. Henrico
Tibbs, formerly of Astley’s Royal Amphi-
theater, London. M. T. excels any per-
former in this act we have ever witnessed.
The finest act of trapeze we have, no
hesitancy in saying, ever witnessed by any
audience, is presented by the Miacco
Brothers. This act was performed for ten
weeks in New York City to enthusiastic
and delighted audiences. We regret that
we had to leave at this juncture, and
therefore failed to witness the performance
of Mad. Marie, the comics, the trick
horse and the animals ; but if they were
as good as those we witnessed, they re-
flected credit on performers and manage*.
' ment. Storey’s celebrated band is with
the company, and they are decidedly the
[ best caterers of musical diet traveling.
The canvass is spacious and fitted out
with an eye single to the convenience
and comfort of families and ladies.
Finely carpeted seats and ample room
around the cages of the animals, lor the
convenient inspection of the audience.

very fair audience in attendance at the
Theater to witness the performance of
the Gipsey King, a beautiful piece pre-
pared expressly for the benefit of little
Nellie Walters, who appeared in the
picturesque part of the "Gipsey Boy,”
and by her fine personation of the
character, elicited frequent applause.

The following needs no comment,
it speaks for itself:
Committee on Relief of Destitute)
in the South,	?
St. Louis, March 23d, 1867. )
The Honorable, the Mayor of the City of
Vicksburg Miss:
Dear Sir—We ship to you, per the
steamboat Welcome. 50 bbls corn meal
and 20 bbls potatoes for distribution,
whenever your judgment may dic-
tate, either in your city or to points in
the interior. As the reports that reach
us of the great distress in the South
are general iu their character, we are
at a loss to know what particular lo-
calities arc most in need, and should
be glad to have any information from
you with regard to your vicinity, that
we may be able to act accordingly.
Yours, respectfully,
J. W. LUKE, Ch’n*
P. S. If claims are urgent, telegraph

must	J. W.
During the 24 hours ending yesterday
evening at 6 o’clock, the river opposite j
this place, L?se four inches and a fraction, -
which is^Aocrease of four inches from the
rise of the 24 hours preceding. This is a
very sudden and remarkable abatement, j
and can only be accounted for by the large
break in the Harris levee, above Omega, :
which we learn from the officers of the
steamer Welcome, occurred day before
yesterday morning. It is always the case,
that an extensive crevasse above, causes a
decrease in the rise below.
We expressed our fears in yesterday’s
report that the Grand Levee at Morganza
would not be able to stand the immense
pressure of water against it if the present
extraordinary rise did not cease in a day or
two, and our vatticinations on the subject
were most fearfully confirmed yesterday,
by Capt. George Hart of the steamer St.
Charles, who informed us that the Grand
Levee at Morganza gave way throe days
since, and flooded all that rich section of
Point Coupee Parish, on the Bayous For^
doche and Atchafalaya. The destruction
of stock and other property in that sec-
tion of country is reported as incalculable.
Our Northwestern exchanges still say
that the upper rivers ure falling as far
down as Memphis, though we learn by
telegram that the Ohio was again rising at
Louisville on the 27th.
The weather here is clear and slightly
cool, with no present indication of rain.
Business on the levee yesterday was
comparatively brisk, many of the boats
having discharged sufficie ntly large freights
to keep the drays and shipping clerks
tolerably busy.
Through a gentleman who came down
on the Mississippi late yesterday evening,
we learn that the Ultz Levee, near Duck"
port, below Miliken’s Bend, is in an ex-
tremely dangerous condition, and a cre-
vasse at that point is momentarily expecti
ed. He also reports the levee at Young’s
Point in an extremely precarious condition,
but brings the consoling intelligence that
the river all the way up above the mouth
of Yasoo is rising so very slowly that it
can almost be said to be at a stand.
We learn on good authority that the
main Bass Levee still holds its own, but
that the upper wing has given way, im
flicting however, very slight damage, and
will be soon closed.
After the immense outlay and trouble
on the levees during the past winter, the
present disastrous tidings are extreme’y
i discouraging,
The New Orleans Picayune of the 27th,
says that Gov. Wells has signed the sev"
' eral bills passed by the Legislature, making
■ appropriations for levee purposes but with'
holds his signature from the bill creating a
Levee Board, to be elected by the Legis-
lature, whose duty it shall be to expend
said moneys. It is supposed that the
Governor will, after the adjournment of
the Legislature, proceed to appoint a
Board in accordance with his own wishes, }
to carry out the provisians of the law. In :
this event, Gen. Sheridan will probably be 1
appealed to by the Board elected by the j
Legislature.

that the steamer Luminary, en route from
St. Louis for New Orleans, with a full
cargo, bursted her larboard cylinder
head, and run through herself Saturday
night, at Richards’ Landing, sixty miles
above here. She reshipped her trip on
the Mollie Able, and will go back to St.
Louis for repairs.
The James River is so high at Richs
mond, as to submerge the pumps of the
water works, thus cutting off the water
supply.
The N. O. Picayune of day before yesi
terday, contains the following interesting
correspondence regarding the levees.
We present below a copy of a dispatch
received yesterday afternoon from Charles
M. Babbitt. Assistant Engineer of the
Second Divis:on of Louisiana Levees, by
the Hon. A. T. Welch member of our
State Senate, and of the Levee Board :
March 26,1867.
Hon. A. T. Welch, Board of Levee Commis-
sioners, New Orleans:
Send me a pile driver and equipments
by first boat to . Vidalia. The Marengo
' Levee is sloughing badly—fifteen feet of
r water on the front and eight feet on the
> back.	Chas. M. Babbitt,
Ass’t Engineer 2d Div. La. Levees.
The matter was at once taken in hand
by Col. Duralde? Chairman of the Levee
Board, who having procured the articles
required, sent the following telegram to
the above:
New Orleans, March’26, 1867.
Chas. M. Babbitt, Ass’t Eng. 2d Div. La.
Levees:
Pile driver and equipments shipped this
evening by steamer Quitman as ordered.
J. V. Duralde,
Chairman Levee Board.
The Marengo Levee is .one of our most
important levees, and was built about a
year ago. It contains 186,741 cubic yards,
and cost $65,000, and has been looked up1
on heretofore as very secure.
The following special dispatches to
the Louisville Courier, regarding the
waters at various points will be read
with interest:

JOHNSONVILLE.
The water was at a stand at Johnson-
ville at 10 o’clock this morning, with
the water sixty feet deep in the chan-
nel. The flood is within 6 inches of
the flooring.
VIOLENT CONDUCT.
About 2 o’clock this morning fifteen
soldiers of the 34th Infantry, troops at
this post, went around to the work-
house, and took violent possession,
and released two of their comrades
and ten other prisoners.
EAST TENNESSEE
papers give vivid details of the de-
struction by the flood. At Kingston
the water rose fifteen feet higher than
ever before known. The rain poured
down almost without intermission for
six days. One-third of the entire town
was inundated, some dwellings were
entirely submerged and others carried
away. The water rose so rapidly that
few articles were saved in any case.
UNPRECEDENTED.
Some citizens who thought their
houses too elevated to be reached, were
only too glad to escape with their
lives, leaving their entire effects to
the mercy of the flood. One man was
driven from the second story to the
garret, whence he was forced to es-
cape by cutting through the roof.
A NEGRO TOWN
in the northern part of Kingston was
swept off clean. A large number of
freedmen, many of whom had just
succeeded in paying for lots occupied
by them as their homes, lost the houses,
and were forced to camp on the river
bank, with nothing but the broad can-
opy of Heaven to protect them from
the torrents then falling.
ONE MILLION BUSHELS OF CORN
is destroyed or lost along the Tennes-
see and Clinch rivers, besides other
immense losses.
The Jonesboro’ Flag says the dam-
age in Washington and surrounding
counties, in the destruction of proper-
ty in
UPPER EAST TENNESSEE,
is immense, and will take years to re-
pair the damage. But two grist mills
are in operation between Jonesboro’
and Elizabethtown, and but few, if
any, on the larger streams but what
. have been swept away or injured.
HOUSES AFLOAT.
The gushing torrents lifted buildings
from their foundations as buoyantly
as they would sail a boat, afterwards
to be dashed against the rocks.- A
friend informed us that he stood upon
the banks of the Watauga and behold
houses, machinery and flatboats ladei
• with various products, of the country
minus helmsmen or oarsmen, house-
, hold and kitchen furniture, bed cloth-
. ing, &c., whirled along the crest pf
,; the tide with great rapidity.
HEART-RENDING SCENES.
At one time he witnessed a house with
the whole family clinging to the wreck
crying aloud for assistance, but who were
beyond the reach of human aid. Since
the water has subsided many dwellings on
the banks of the neighboring rivers are
found to be swept away, and their OWip
pants missing.
Six men were drowned at Kingsport, (/
which a large portion of the improvements
on the lowlands are submerged and des-
troyed.	- f

can take pleasure in presenting and the au-
dience in witnessing their achievements.
