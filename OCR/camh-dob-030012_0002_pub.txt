Harry Moss left on the Kate Kinney,
Sunday night, to attend the Railroad on-
vention which assembles in Memphis on
the 5th inst.
Gens. Johnston and Hardee were
on the floor of the Louisiana House of
Representatives Saturday, and were
invited to seats in the bar. Truly
Louisiana must be disloyal, and hasn’t
the fear of the Military bill before her
eyes.	_
From the Index, we learn that the sma 1
pox is abating in Columbus.
The suspension of the writ of habeas
corpus has been prolonged in Ireland.
JudgeBusteed having been mentioned
in connection with the Governorship of
Alabama, the Columbus Sun is inspired to
say this:
Rock-a-by Alabama, and be not disgusted,
For when your back breaks your head may be
“Busteed.”
[From the Advertiser md Register.
MILITARY LAW REVIVED IN
MOBILE.
A circumstance occurred yesterday
in this city, which, we presume, may
be regarded as a foreshadowing of
what is to be expected under the oper-
ations of the recent legislation of
Congress. The facts, as related to i.s,
are substantially as follows:
Capt. Wm. D. Smith, an old citizen
and prominent member of the Mobile
Fire Department, commanding a com-
pany in the 24th Alabama Regiment,
was killed at the battle of Murfrees-
boro, more than four years ago, and
buried on the field. His remains were
disinterred by his friends and brought
to Mobile, and yesterday were buried
by his brother tiremen. The proces-
sion was exclusively under the direc-
tion of the Fire Department, and there
was no military display or memorial
connected with it.
The funeral procession took the
usual route to the cemetery, which
passes by the military camp on Gov-
ernment street. As the cortege was
passing, it was halted by an officer,
whose name and rank we have not
learned, but who is supposed to be the
commandant of the troops now sta-
tioned in ilobile. This officer inquir-
ed whose remains were being carried
by. Chief Engineer Lyons, of the
Fire Department, answered that they
were those of " Mr. Smith, a promi-
nent fireman.” The officer asked if he
was only a fireman. Mr. Lyons an-
swered in the affirmative, when the
officer directed the procession to pass
on. The Chief Engineer, however,
immediately correcting himself, said
to the officer that he did not wish to
deceive him in any respect, and that
the deceased had been a Confederate
soldier. Upon this the officer declared
that the procession must not pass.
“Very well, said the Chief Engineer,
in a respectful manner, "I will turn
back and take another street.”
According to our information, the
officer still exhibited some hesitation
about enforcing his order, and asked
when the deceased had died. The
answer was that he was killed in battle
several years ago. The officer then
very promptly and decidedly declared
that, if that were the case, the body
could not pass. The Chief Engineer
accordingly countermarched the pro-
cession and took it to the cemetery by
another route.
But little comment is necessary.
The street was a public one, and al-
though, as we are informed, the ground
claimed by the military authorities as
their own extends beyond this street,
yet the ground actually occupied is
only on one side of it. However this
may be, it is the route, or one of the
routes, usually taken by funeral pro-
cessions in passing to the cemetery. It
is said that no such procession haMver
heretofore been interfered with.
Although Captain Smith was a Con-
federate officer and fell on the fleld of
battle, yet, as we have already stated,
the honors paid to his remains were
purely civic. There was no “rebel”
flag—no memorial of the cause in
which he fell—no military demonstra-
tion whatever, unless the fact that the
funeral band was playing the Dead
March, could be construed as such.
More than this—we are able to state
a fact, which places the extreme cau-
tion and moderation of the conductors
of the ceremonies in a yet stronger
light. On the evening before the fu-
neral, at half-past 9 o’clock, the Chief
Engineer of the Fire Department, ac-
companied by another member of the
same, came to this office to ask that
a notice should be made of it in our
local columns. He particularly re-
quested that no allusion should be
made to Capt. Smith’s military career
or the circumstances of his death, and,
although the writer would have pre-
ferred to mention these circumstances,
yet the notice was written in exact ac-
cordance with the wishes of Mr. Lyons,
and without any mention of the de-
ceased, except as a fireman. The only
offence that had been committed was
the offence of Captain Smith in laying
down his life for his country more
than four veal's ago.
As for the officer who interrupted
the funeral, he is greatly to be pitied.
To an honorable man it must be ex-
cessively humiliating and mortifying
to execute orders that require him to
offer an indignity to the body of a
brave soldier. It has been character-
istic of generous and honorable mem-
bers of the profession of arms, in all
ages and in all countries,, to show the
most scrupulous respect to the remains
of a fallen foe. Lawrence was buried
by the chivalrous Broke, and his com-
rades with higher honor than would
have been shown even to the body of
a British officer. McClellan wept over
the corpse of Pegram. We can feel
for the humiliation that must have
crimsoned the cheek of an American
officer in ordering the mouldering re-
mains of a brave Confederate to be
“turned back”from passing his camp,
and can imagine that he might almost
envy the fate of the deceased, whose
memory was honored by the interrup-
tion '	>
VICKSBURG TIMES, TUESDAY, MARCH 5, 1867.
----------------7--------------'—"—
The Military Reconstruction bill
passed both Houses of Congress on
Saturday, notwithstanding the veto of
the President, and is now a law. In
the Senate, the vote stood 28 yeas to
10 nays; in the House of Represen-
tatives, 135 yeas to 47 nays. The scene
in the House during its consideration
is described as extraordinary. At one
time the Democratic members an-
nounced their determination to resist
its passage by all the means in their
power; but the Speaker decided that,
during the last ten days of the session,
all rules could be suspended by a two-
thirds vote, thus defeating all dilatory
motions. The proceedings of the Sen-
ate were less violent. An abstract of
the message of the President will be
found in our telegraphic columns.
The Loss of the Sumter.—The Atlam
tc Cable announced yesterday that “the
famous ox-reb 1 ste mer Sumter has been
ost in the North Se It has thu
shared the .ate of the cause it was designer
to serve. Its name commemorated the
first Confederate triumph—the ca tu e 01
a defenceless fort. And as the authors ol
that rebellious achievementunHerestimateu
the force of the patriotic Northern senti
ment which oyerwhelmel them, their
steamer in a vain attempt to stem the cun
rents of he North Sea, has sunk to 1 ise
n more.
The above is from the Philedelphia
Press- Wc quote it not to notice gibe 0
sneer, but merely to say thas a very diffen
ent omen may be read in the Sumter’&
late- The Radical policy is the “vain at*
tempt to stem the currents,, of human
nature and the decrees of the Creator,
will make the South as valueless to the
Union as the Sumter has proved to the
Federal navy.—[Richmond Enquirer.

Paris, Feb. 12th, 1867.
To the Editor of the Vicksburg Times:
THE COMING FIGHT.
We are all now looking forward to the
opening of the French Chambers, which
will take place on the 14th of the present
month. The Opposition is mustering all
its force, in order to attack the govern-
ment.
A few very unpleasant questions will be
put to the Ministers of His Majesty, Na-
poleon the Third. Such subjects as Mexico,
Germany, the rapid growth of Prussia
will be touched upon, and thjre is every
reason to believe that the debates will be
ot thrilling interest.
A meeting of the Opposition Deputies
took p ace a few evening? ago, at Mon.
Maries. This gentleman is one of the
most prominent men amongst the an tag’
onists of the present dyna ty. Resolu-
tions were adopted, to ask at the earliest
moment, explanations as to the suppres-
sion of the address, should the interpreta-
tion be authorized as appears probable;
the discussion will be confined as much as
possible, to what concerns the attributions
of the chamber. The Deputies, not wish’
ing to express prematurely their opinion
on the home situation, which will only be
closely defined by the publication of the
bills, on the press and the right of meetT
ing, (droit de reunion-)
Nor do they wish to
the great question of
which is the principal
the country, and which will be treated in
its turn, with all the developement it re^
quires- The left bas therefore decided to
question the government on the suppres-
sion of the address, on the interior situa-
tion, on the affairs of Germany, and even
on those of Mexico, but it will choose its
own moment*
certain as earty as possible by unmistaka-
ble results, its opportuneness, or its objec-
tionable character, as the case might be.
He had scarcely employed the few first
weeks of his government in examining the
ground, and had no.sooner acquired the
conviction that an arrangement must be
made with Hungary, than he was seen to
take the road to Pesth, in order to ascer-
tain, by his own observations, the real sit-
uation in Hungary. Since that journey
he has not lost sight ot the Hungarian
question, aud has constantly had the solu’
tion of it in view. He went straight to
the point with a celerity and energy we are
not accustomed to witness in Austrian
Ministers- He did not act more than was
necessary from an Austrian point of view,
>r than he considered realizable in the
interests of the Hungarians, and every one
in Austria is forced to admit that he had
done more in a few weeks than all his prei
lecessors during as many years.
The parliamentary session in Prussia is
ip proaching its close, all the important
bills are voted and nothing remains but
that on the augmentation of the number
if members of the lower Chamber, which
the nobles will have to discuss on a second
reading.
THE NEW JAPANESE MISSION IN PARIS.
The new Japanese Mission has arrived
at the Grand Hotel in Paris. It consists
of Twash ta, envoy from the King of Ja^
pan ; Ttithon, Secretary; SerahawaTwasi,
Nemonla, Sibouqe, and Midoda, officers,
and several servants.
THE PARIS EXHIBITON.
All Paris is now turning its attention to
the Exhibition. A visit to the Exhibition
building which is very like a large Gasom
eter, would be interesting enough.at pres-
ent were it not for the great quantity of
rain that has fallen of late, and which has
made the ground around the building
about as pleasant to walk in as an Irish
bog. The most fabulous stories are being
told respecting the numbers of visitors ex-
pected in Paris. The United States Amen
icans at present residing in the French
Capital, assert that more than a hundred
thousand of their fellow countrymen in-
tend spending the greater part of next
Summer here. One thing is however cer-
tain, and that is that all the berths on
board the trans-Atlantic steamers have
been bespoken from April to September.

OPENING OF SEEING TRADES
KAHN
W OULD INFORM THEIR FRIENDS OF VICKSBURG AND VICINITY, THAT TH El
THE CIRCULAR OF THE COUNT DE CHAM’
BO .ID, ALIAS HENRIE V-
As was to be expected, the circular of
M. Vandal, Director General of the French
Postoffice, . ordering his subordinates to
seize the Count de Chambord’s letter, has
excited a considerable commotion among
the Paris journals. They not only declare
the order so given to be altogether illegal,
but they affirm that such an interference
with the secrecy of communications, sent
through the French Post office, excites a
feeling of uneasiness and even alarm, that
will with difficulty be allayed. These
journals seem to think that the circular of
the Director General of the Postoffice
seems to call for an explantion from the
Government, not only in a legal point of
view, but*still more from a moral one, so
that no one may think that his letters the
depositaries of his most intrinsic thoughts,
should be handed over to the investiga-
tions of the agent $ charged to transmit
them, and that it only depends upon a too
zealous clerk to penetrate the privacy of his
interests or his li.e, under pretext that his
confidences are enclosed in a suspected
envelope. It cannot be possible, that on
the 24th of January, five days after the
date rendered memorable by a new initia-
tive of the Emperor, in the sense of liberty
the agents of a great administration should
have received instructions, such as those
which strike us at the first glance of the
document. One, however, must abstain
from any further strictures until the ex-
planations of the Government are given.
The advisers of the Emperor would have
had an easy mode of naturalising any dan.
ger connected with the Count de Cham-
bord’s missive, by publishing it in the
official journal, the Monitjur, as was wisely
done at the end of 1851, especially as the
obnoxious circular had appeared in the
Times, which is now allowed to be distribw
ted all over France.
FOREIGN POLITICS.
As regards foreign politics everything
presents a dead calm at present in Europe.
It seems more than likely that the Holy
Father will come to an understanding with
the King of Italy, notwithstanding the
outcry made in the Italian Parliament.
Baron Von Bedst seems to be acting
with much activity in Austria. This Mini
ister has a considerable advantage over all
the Ministers whom Austria has had dur-
ing the last years, namely, his system of
promptly and energetically carrying out
every measure commenced- iu order to ast

PASSMAN’S PATENT IE ON TIES
FOR COTTON BALES. G
BUCKLE AND BUTTON TIE, United States Patent, April I860.
THE Hoops are cut to lengths of 10,10^ and 11 feet. Ten feet are most generally used, but 10s'
and 11 are sometimes required for large bales. The buckles are fastened to the hoops; the but-
tons will be put up in small boxes. The weight is about Ten Pounds to the Bale of Cotton.
My Button Tie as the first offered for sale to any extent in the South, and has been used by
thousands of planters with universal approval. I have made a valuable improvement in the
shape of the button since it was first introduced; and have also procured a patent for a BUCKLE
TIE, which, for simplicity, facility and expedition of adjustment to bales of any or of unequal
size, and for security in holding, is, I think, superior to any offered to the public.
The advantages of iron over Rope for baling Cotton are now'universally acknowledged. It holds
the bale in a much smaller compass; is applied and fastened with as much facility, both in the
country pressing and the recompressing at the sea-ports ; lessens immensely the risk from fire;
is strong, and its strength is not impaired by time and exposure as is that of rope. This last ad-
vantage has been strikingly manifested during the w ar. Thousands of bales of Cotton have been
lost by the rotting or breaking of Rope, which could have been preserved if Iron hoops had been
used. In addition to this, it can be furnished cheaper than rope. The derangement of; labor in
the hemp grow ing States has reduced the supply of hemp to such an extent as to causeqirices to
rule unprecedentedly high; indeed, a sufficiency for baling a moderate cotton crop, cannot be re-
lied on at any price.
I have arranged for the importation of a large quantity of the best English Iron, and have made
arrangements w ith Messrs. Chambers & Latting for the sale and delivery of my Ties. Parties
ordering, or desiring farther information on the subject, will please address
CHAMBERS & LATTING, No. 61 Carondelet street, New Orleans.
SHIP REFUGE, NEW Orleans, July 7th, 1850.
H. Fassman, Esq., Orleans Cotton Press: Sir—In January last I received from your Press 1809
bales of Cotton, of which about 1000 were compressed and bound with your new “Iron Tie.” I can
safely aftirm that the cotton so bouqd was received in better order than it generally conies from
the Presses; that it stowed better, arid enabled the ship to carry more than on any previous voy-
age. The cotton when discharged from the ship in Liverpool, was in better order than the rope
bound cotton. It is highly preferable for a ground tier,’ as the damp arising from the ballast has
no effect upon it, for it is well-know n by practical men that damps will rot the rope bound. I cau
confidently recommend your “Iron Tie,” as I took this lot for an experiment aud carefully watched
it both in loading and discharging. Yours respectfully, JOHN HOWARD, Master.
Certificate of Eire Wardens of the Mew Orleans Insurance Companies, and of Alfred
lancer, Esq., er.-Chief Engineer Fire Department:
The undersigned, Fire Warden and Fire Inspector of the New Orleans Insurance Companies
are of the opinion that the Iron Tie affords greater protection against loss iu case of fire than tbo
old style of baling with rope. J. YOUENNES, Fire Warden ; JOHN A DAMS, Fire Inspector
I concur in the above.	ALFRED BELANGER, ex-Chief Engineer Fire Department.
Samples of the Tie can be seen and orders left at the following named houses in Vicksburg :

PROCEEDINGS OF MERCHANTS’
MEETING.

ment, at Hall of Vicksburg Library Asso’
ciation, Capt. C. A- Manlove, Chairman,
P. W. Shearer, Secretary.
Report of Committee to confer with
wharf boat proprietors, and to establish
a uniform tariff of charges for forwarding,
storage, &c., presented by Mr. Hartigan.
Said report after considerable discussion,
was unanimously adopted, as follows :
Articles of agreement made and entered into
this 27th day of February, 1867, by and be-
tween the Merchants of the City of/Vicks-
burg and the Proprietors of the Wharf-
boats, now lying at the Vicksburg Land-
The Proprietors of the Wharf boats shall
be allowed to charge one cent per package
on allfreight delivered to them by all boats,
either by day or night, on wharf boat, or
levee, and an additional’ charge of two
cents per package for each and every
twenty’four hours that it remains in their
care after the consignee has been .duly
notified; they shall also be allowed to
charge twenty-five cents for any number of
packages delivered to them under five, (5,)
and all freight by the New Orleans and
Vicksburg packets shall be exempt from the
above assessment. They shall also make
. the above charges on all goods they may
: forward, in addition to the charge for for
■ warding, as per the following tariff, viz •
The following Tariff we hereby es-
tablish as the rates to be charged to
merchants for receiving, forwaiding,
i storage and drayage, which tariff we
; pledge ourselves to carry out in good
b faith:

Dr. H. Shannon has returned to the
city, and can be found at his office, over
Ellis & Warner’s old stand.
H. C- Clarke has sent us the Galaxy

We are indebted to Mr. John Lee, the
gentlemanly Mail Agent on the Southern
railroad, for late favors._________
Messrs. Woodruff & Diserens have
our thanks for the St. Louis Times, Dem-
ocrat and Republican, of 2d ; Chicago

It is currently reported that 2,000
cavalry arrived here yesterday. We
haven’t seen ’em yet, but presume they
come to enforce the Military bill—that
will require more than two th.usand,
We call’ the special attention of our
business men, to the fact, that the steadier
Emma No. 2, leaves to-day, on her first
trip as a Vicksburg and Bend’s packet.
Hereafter, should she receive that custom
•which is justly her due, Vicksburg mer-
chants may expe t orders to be filled by
them, instead of being sent to Memphis
and New Orleans. The Emma is com-
manded by as clever a gent eman as ever
trod the hurricane deck, viz: Andy Young
—while those court ou - gentlemen G. 8.
Connery and Billy Marsh will be found in
the office. Success and prosperity to the
Emma say we. ,	_
“De Lee, the Beautiful,” mad^her
debut in the Hill City last night, before a
large and fashionable audience, in the
dramatization of Cooper’s nive’, the
“Wept-of-the'Wish’Ton-Wish” and Nan
the Good for Nothing.” The first piece
affords but little scope for dramatic powers
but her little was perfect. Her persona-
tion of Nan was original, and stamps her
as a comedienne of the first rank. En pas*
sant, the rendition of Canonchet, by Mr.
Walters, was very fine. The minor char-
acters were well sustained- .	, .
To’night, a really fine bill is up—in
which De Lee will be able, no doubt, to do
h.wself full justice. p

The river is still rising, and more rapid’ >

several days before-
During the day Sunday it was almost _
Stationery, but yesterday it rose 3i inches,
and begins to seriously threaten the entire
low lands.. From entirely reliable sources
we learn that almost the whole of Chicot
county, Arkansas, is under water; some of
the plantations in Madison parish are also
submerged, and the Haves’ Harris levee is
expected to break. Should this levee give
way, the whole country back for miles
will be overflowed, with the most disas-
trous results to the planters.
A fair amount of business was transact'
ed on the levee yesterday.
The weather since our last report, has
been oi a character most extraordinary to
those who are not well acquainted with the
vicissitudes of the Southern climate. On
Sunday it was extremely hot and dusty,
with a brisk Southern wind; yesterday a
norther commenced blowing, chilling the
atmosphere until, by dark, over-coats were
a necessity...

The Mississippi Valley Transportation

be up at noon to’day with a number of
barges in tow for St- Ibuis. Shippers of

carried more cheaply by this line than by
any other. W. M. Williams & Co. are
agents for this line.
