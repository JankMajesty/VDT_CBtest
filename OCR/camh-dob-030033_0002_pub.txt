—In the New Jersey Assembly, on Wedw
neaday, the report of the committee in
favor of amending the State constitution
mo as to allow colored persons to vote, has
been rejected. The Assembly is compos'
ed of a majority of Radicals. Congress
should at once send on an 4‘investigating
committee’' to that body, to see if the
State ought not to be “territorialized. '’
An unusual freshet has been making
great havoc among manufacturers of
Eastern Connecticut. Dams, woolen
mills, cotton mills, paper mills and
other establishments have been swept
away in whole or in part, and costly
machinery lies scattered for miles over
the country and in swamps whither
its fragments have been carried by the
rushing torrents.

Nrw York, March 25. The official
report of the St. Patrick’s day riot says
thirty three policemen were injured, nine
seriously and nine dangerously. All are

Washington, March 25.—Hopes for
the early release of Mi -Davis gain strength.
Jail Delivery.—Our town of DeSoto
is nearly all under water, and it has reach-
ed the floor of the “lock-up.” which is the
only prison in the parish. There have been
several prisoners confined therein for va1
rious offenses, none of a very grave char
acter, however, and Mr. Nolly has con-
cluded that neither humanity or justice re'
quires Him to keep these persons in a
prison the floor of which is covered with
water, and we agree with him entirely. —
The “lock'up” will not answer for a high
water prison. It is an excellent low water
one.—[Madison Journal.
The time is at hand when the people of
the South should choose the path they are
to follow. J ‘As to a young man the elec-
tion of his shrine fixes the whole current
of his life’s course ;” so do the objects of
a nation’s love and reverence afford a cri-
terion whereby to foreknow its future.
Hard work and strenuous endeavor is our
lot for a long period to come, and from this
stern schooling must spring that positive
and high-striving character which will, in
time to come, exalt the South to promi-
nence among the nations of the earth.
With our manifest destiny there is allied a
manifest duty which we must discharge to
the fullest extent. Though our brief
dream of glory has passed away with the
dark shadow of war, we can still, in the
golden paths of peace, achieve a place
whi?h will be, in yet far distant years, a
precious heritage to those who will follow
us. We must build up and beautify oiir
desolated land, and it will not only be our
duty to excel in acres, rivers, grain, cattle,
steamboats, and all the adjuncts of pros'
perous civilization ; but in all those lofty,
moral and intellectual attributes which,
amid the dying years, die not. Being
(whether we will or no,) sponsors to urn
born generations, we cannot blamelessly
be insignificant. We live not only to mean
something, but to do something, and let
the path be chosen now and steadily kept
in view. Let the choice be in view of our
national position and prospects—of tchat
we really are, and what we ought to be,
A State is not made great by those whose
first worship is to wealth ; who sell souls
for gilded dross; who prefer spoils to rec-
titude ; or seeming rich to being honest.
Long enough has the South bent the knee
to idle visions—long enough chased phan-
tasmal glories, through blood and tears.
She is now summoned to nobler services,
the doing of which will waken pssns of un-
mixed joy through the vast hall of the
future. Here, in the land hallowed by
precious memories, we can yet lay the
foundation of power and might. Bend
every energy to the task—throw doubt and
despondency to the winds, and all will yet
be well. Possessing vast and varied re-
sources, we have but to work to develop
them. We must have a community of in-
terest, and work together in building up
and repairing our shattered fortunes. Let
the money made at home, be spent at
home, and not squandered among those
who have proven themselves our enemies.
Southern merchants and Southern manu-
facturers can compete with those of the
North, provided they are encouraged.
True it is that, at present, we are straight-
ened for capital; but that is an evil which
will soon be remedied by industry and en-
ergy. To work, then; to work; on the
plantation and in the workshop, in the
My and in the country, and not many
years will pass away before our fortune and
prosperity are restored, and we will move
on grandly to a happy future.
We make the following excerpts from
the St. Louis Journal of Commerce of
23d, concerning trade in that city,
Provisions—The market has beea
somewhat excited since our last date, and
and prices of nearly all articles coining un-
der this head have advanced. Owing to
the continued suspension of navigation
upon the upper rivers, the supplies corn'
ing forward from the country are light,
and are taken immediately i upon arrival
by shippers and dealers, and consequent-
ly there has been no increase in stocks
from this source. This fact, together
with the continued consumptive demand
from the South, and considerable of an im
quiry for foreign export, which was not to
any great extent anticipated by packers
and dealers early in the season, has stiff-
ened up the market, not only here but
throughout the country, and dealers who
were sellers two weeks ago have now ew
tered the market as buyers. This has
caused great buoyancy in the market, and
the sales of the week have been heavy, al-
though the exact amounts cannot be giv-
en, for the reason that a number of large
speculative transactions were on terms not
made public. Mess pork sold on Friday
last at $21@22, but commenced advanc-
ings and closed firm on Monday at $23, at
which figure it has ruled steady to the
close. VVe note sales to-day of 200 bbls
mess pork at $23; 10 bbls prime mess at
$19 50 ; 150,000 lbs bulk rib sides on pri-
vate terms ; 70 cks. city bacon at 9£c. for
shoulders, lljc. for rib sides; 12c. for
clear rib do., and 12}c. for clear sides :
600 pcs. shoulders at 9c, and 20,000 lbs
clear sides loose at 12jc.; 50,000 lbs clear
sides packed at 13c.; 500 pieces plain city
sugar cured hams at 141c., and 250 do. do.
canvassed at 151c. P kb. sales were also
made of 100 tcs. prime steam lard at 12c.;
26 tcs. and 20 bbls kettle do. at 12}c.; 106
tierces prime do. at 12}c.; 104 kegs at
13}c., and 762 kegs choice at 14c. Pm.
The supply of com has not been large,
and with an increased order demand from
the South the market has ruled active and
higher prices have been realized. There
has been also a large advance in the New
York market, caused by an active export
demand, which has had an indirect effect
upon the market here, and unless there
should be a larger quantity locked up at
interior points by the suspension of navh
gation than is generally supposed, present
prices will be sustained, even if a further
advance does not take place upon choice
white suitable for milling. The offerings
to-day were large, but prices were main-
tained for prime and choice, while com-
mon was generally neglected. We note
sales of 257 sacks mixed at $1 64; 2,500
sacks yellow at $1 66; 150 do. at $1 67 ;
658 sacks yellow at $1 68; 324 sacks yel-
low at $1 70; 187 do. choice at $1 72;
3,375 sacks prime white at $17O@171 ;
4,084 do., delivered at $183 : 360 do. ex'
tra choice white at $1 78; 123 sacks mix-
ed white at $1 67, and 851 sacks do. at
$1 66 P cental.

Murder.—Gen. Howard estimates
the number of deaths among the ne-
groes, within two years, at a million.
Each one of these negroes, were his
tombstone properly labeled, would
have above him the inscription : "Died
of abolitionism.”—[Exchange.
Give the negro the right of suffrage,
and such other inducements to laziness
as the ingenuity of hate for the white
race can invent, and complete the work
of extermination begun by emancipa-
tion. Such are the fruits of fanaticism
and folly. The Garrisons and Gerrit
Smiths, and Beecher Stowes, and
Whittiers and Wendell Phillipses are
the ministers of death to the negro
race.—JMemphis Appeal.
An Awful Railroad Accident.—
A serious accident occurred on the
Pittsburg, Columbus & Cincinnati
Railroad on Thursday last. The night
express west? which was closely fol-
lowed by the Steubensville accommo-
dation, had stopped at a water-station,
ten miles east of Steubenville, for wa-
ter. It was somewhat behind time,
though still in advance of the time of
the accommodation. On starting up,
after getting water, a coupling broke,
detaching the two rear cars of the
train, and before a fresh coupling could
be made, the accommodation came up
behind.and dashed into the detached
cars of the forward train with appal-
ling force. The rear car was driven
completely through the one ahead,
which, full of passeners, was crushed
to a mass of splintered timbers.
At the first alarm from the approach-
ing train, one passenger had quickly
raised a window and thrust his, head
out; in an instant the head was torn
from his shoulders, and was afterward
found at a considerable distance from
the wreck. All the other passengers were
fastened in the mass of broken timbers,
which, to ,add to the horror, took fire from
a stove which had been thrown on its top.
'Through the exertions of the conductor,
baggageman, and a single passenger from
the rear car, who had his wits about him,
the fire was extinguished, when by slow
work the passengers were extricated from
their perilous situation; all, with one or
two exceptions, more or less injured. Two
had both legs broken, six otners one leg
each ; some had broken ribs, others broken
noses, and so on. An elderly gentleman
and a two year old boy alone escaped all
injury, while of the wounded it was thought
that four or more would die.

The Richmond Times says let it be the
first and last aim of our statesmanship to
defeat the object of those who would cre-
ate new streams of power to use them for
their own selfish ends. When the negro
casts a vote let us see to it that he casts i t
right. Let us not permit that un be-
tween the ignorant blacks and the false
and abandoned whites, which, when once
consummated, will be pregnant with dis-
aster to every moral and rational interest
in this Commonwealth. We do fiot say
that our high-toned gentleman shall go on
electioneering tours to Ouffee'tz cabin and
give candy to the piccaninnies-no. But
let the benighted masses be instructed
through those of their own color who are
most intelligent and respectable, so that
vile demagogues and political swindlers
may not make them their tools.

Mr. Davis.—We published a para'
graph recently in regard to Mr. Davis and
his pecuniary condition, which has called.
out the following letter. The Baltimore
Gazette vouches for the high character of
its author:
If Gen. Miles received remittances for
Mr. Davis to the amount of $25,000, as
reported, the fact was concealed from Mr.
Davis. It is not true that all restrictions
upon Mr. Davis’s correspondents have
been removed.
Letters addressed to him are still sent to
the commanding officer, and as they reach
Mr- Davis consist of applications for autQs
biography and northern letters of low ma-
lignity. The only pecuniary evidences
are notes, purporting to be issues of the
Confederate government, but generally, if
not always, counterfeits of the style ad-
vertised for sale in Philadelphia some
years since.
About Christmas some friends in Mary-
land and Virginia did send boxes of pro»
visions as presents appropriate to the sea-
son—say three or four boxes. There was
also from Boston a box of books, sent by
visions as presents appropriate to the sea-
son—say three or four boxes. There was
also from .ooavoii a oox vi uuujlb. bcuu uy
one whose kind nature revolted at the
barbarity towards a prisoner so constantly
witnessed by one residing there. v
Our noble and generous people have
from time to time, out of the scanty means
left to them by tne incendiary, plunder-
ing armies of the North, sent to Mr. Davis’
wife and children, means of support.—
Sometimes little children offer assistance
to the little children of the imprisoned
father.
Had the usages of civil war been observ-
ed, Mr. Davis’s private property would
have sufficed them, or had he been per'
mitted to labor for their support he would
have rendered such, aid unnecessary; but
the people act upon the knowledge that
he was robbed of Everything, including
his books, furniture, diplomas, commis*
sions, testimonials, even a large part ef
his wearing apparel, aye,', and that of his
wife and little children, whose trunks
were pillaged on the ship where, after
taking him and their servants from them,
they were still kept prisoners. The men?
dacious newsman, writing for such as him-
self, desires to make a sensation because
Mr. Davis is no longer fettered and guard'
ed in a cell.”
We condense the following, from thp N'
O. Times of 26th.
NEW ORLEANS TIMES OFFICE.
Monday Evening, March, 23, 1867.
Cotton—As we intimated the pros-
pect to be, in our evening’s edition, a very
'fair Monday’s business has been done—
near 5000 bales being sold at rather irreg-
ular prices. There would have been more
but factors were very stiff in their rates,
where they offered lists on the market at
all. Brokers had great difficulty finding
what they wanted in the upper grades,
the proportion of lower qualities being
greater on the market. We give quotai
tions to correspond with this- feature of
the market, viz: 26j@27c. for ordinary,
27}@28c. for good ordinary, 29@29|c. for
low middling, and 30@30|c, per lb for
middling, Liverpool classification. Ab
though some cotton was bought at the
opening this morning, before the recep-
tion of the Liverpool advance, at lower
figures, it was difficult afterwards, to find
the better grades at anything below these
quotations, and purchases were still being
made when we left the market at four
o’clock: Receipts since Saturday reach
6009 bales, against 4^95 for same time
last week. Last three days’ receipts 6,728
bales against 8,892 bales for first three
days of last week—a decrease of 2,074
bales thus far.

vertisement, he has returned from New

THE OPEREERO.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever, of
which nature—the Opera—severely par-
takes, being of that species.
The Opera is a thing which is never en-
joyed unless it is heard. It is one of those
promiscuous musical arrangements which is
never understood unless it is duly appre-
ciated. In order to experience it effectu-
ally, a libretto, an opera glass, a well
dressed lady, and a clean shirt are necessary.
We obtained all these at immense expense,
and went. Ou looking at the back of our
libretto, we saw that the opera on this occa-
sion, was “Ernanny.” On looking through
our glasses at the stage, we saw a senti’
mental looking bushwhacker standing on a
small mountain, with several more bush-
whackers at the bottom. Having asked
the lady, of whom we were the escorter,
who that was on the mountain, and she
having replied ‘ ‘Ernanny’ ’ in the affirma-
tive, we were morally convinced that it
was the opera of “Ernanny,” before whom
we were arrayed in our paper-collar glory.
The orchestra struck up like four hun-
dred tom cats in a back alley, and a brin-
bls cur dog chained to the garden palings
on a sweet moonlight night in April, and
the bushwhackers at the foot of the moun-
tain all of a sudden commenced to shake
expensive silver goblets in the soft Italian
air, and holler bravero, and play draw
poker on the rocks, and sing hymns to
“Ernanny” on top of the mountain,
who finally relaxed his sentimental ex-
pression, and sang out: “This is the
Grandeero Opereero Mexicaneero De Rio
Janerio by Jingo,” and he came down from
the mountain, and mingled freely with the
common high private bushwhackers, and
thsy all stood on their tip-toes and tried to
sing louder than each other; but at last the
man with the big red fiddle played foul on
the high private bushwhackers, and quit
playing to give “Ernanny” a chance, who
forthwith jumped up on a rock and sang:
“Braueero, eavaZeero, I loveero, a lac/eero in
yonifeero castelZeero, now put on your soim
treeros and follow this gay gamboZeero to
finrZeero his brirZeero, for I’m the big •min'.
go of this here opereero houseero which be-
longs to Mr. Botto,” and then they all
went off between two pictures representing
trees. &c., and the scene changed as if by
some human agency, to an elegant bed
chamber in a big fine house, where there
were about thirty chambermaids singing
Lorena in Italian to a beautiful girl, who
had on a long white veil reaching to the
floor, and she sang back at the chamber-
maids, and they all made so much fuss,
we couldn’t tell what they said, though it
sounded to us exactly like scrambled eggs
look : and then they all disappeared sud-
denly, and a fellow wearing red breeches
and a sky blue jacket, with almost as much
gold lace on it as a post quartermaster of
the present day, ran out and commenced
singing. He was evidently embarrassed,
we presume because in the hurry of dress-
ing his part, he had put on his shirt up-
aide down and turned the wrong end down
over his shoulders for a collar. When the
applause, which this accident created, had
subsided he sang: “Hello, Elvira, I want
to know where in the helZeero is that dam
son of a tmko “Ernanny;” this is Carlo
just got in from the eZepot and Ernanny
is a white livered muZa<to who belonged to
the Freedmen’s Bureau in Ohio, and kept
a possado in Cairoand then Elvira
rushed in by a side door and sang: “He’s
gone to DeSoto,” and replied tunefully
Carlo: “He’d better keep on to Mexico or
Zdaho, or I’ll give him a taste of my big
toe, just so, and put a veto on his coming
here with his lingo and his Z>«njo any
more, for he’s a big pile of gu—an—no;
and Elvira rolled up her eyes and looked
as if she had the hippo and sang: “ Carlo
you know you are aZso ditto and you smell
of tobacco,” and then he sang : “You are
a Virago.”
The scene changed, and in rushed “Er-
nanny” like a sirocco, looking quite mel-
low and swore he was just from Morocco,
where he lost everything he had with a
ysllow fellow at faro except the clothes he
bought of Demb. Carlo sangout: “So
so, dirty fellow, you must rush in on us
like a bull buffalo—go to you saucy beau,
or J’I throw you out the door, probono pub*
lico. Then in ran Jaco and Ricardo, and
Carlo asked them, “sing ly” what there
was for dinno, and each replied: “A sweet
potato and some gum b o.
The curtain dropped on the crowd as
they were going into dinner, which ended
the first act, and we went gradually along
down to the Times office, to write them a
notice, but going back, we “saw so many
men” that when we got to the opera it
was shut up, and somborfeero had gone off
with our ladearo ip»o facto.

Vicksburg is now the healthiest city
in the world. The sexton’s report only
showed one death during last week. The
Doctors all have the blues and can be seen
standing on the corners, and near drug-
stores by the dozen, without even display-
ing the usual professional badges of glove
and whip- One of the poor devils became
so desperate yesterday, that he called on
us and proposed for the situation of sub-
associate—deputy-editor at board wages.

mirth provoking Harry. The laugha-
ble comedietta, “A Day after the Weli-
ding,” was played first. Then came
the roaring farce “April Fool,” and
the evening’s entertainment closed
gloriously with the “Dumb Boy of
Manchester,” in which Mr. Gilbert as

propounding the following interroga-
tories, and give us true replies :
1st. Can you tell why the City au-
thorities allow the “breaking” of
young mules to drays, through the
most frequented part of the city, there-
by endangering life ? Why is it al-
lowed at all inside the corporate
limits ?
2d. Why should decaying vegeta-
bles, such as cabbage, potatoes, onions,
etc., be allowed to remain in the cel-
lars along Washington street? The
odor arising through the gratings is
offensive and unhealthy.
3d. Why is the Postoflice swept out
just at the opening in the morning,
when there is always a crowd around
the door ? Or why swept at all dur-
ing business hours ? FIFTH.
[1st. Because they have been demor-
alized by the anarchy existing at
Washington City.
2d. In hopes that the cholera will
kill off all the freedmen who hang
around town, instead of going in the
country to work.
3d. Because of the disarrangement
of postal affairs in America generally, j
mar fa rewell benefit of miss

RIVER NEWS.
During the twenty-four hours ending at
6 o’clock yesterday evening, the river had
risen exactly eight inches and a quarter.
Such an immense rise is almost unpar-
alleled in river history, and we can hardly
reconcile ourselves to the repealed news of
the falling of the upper rivers, and the
“OldFather,” even as far down as Mem-
phis ; but we think our information to that
effect is correct, and we can only account
for the extraordinary rise at this point by
the supposition that it comes from the
Yazoo and its far reaching tributaries,
which are at a higher stage than has ever
before oeen known.
The levee presents a really alarming
aspect, and the stores fronting the river
will soon become untenable if the present
rise continues for two days longer. It is
positively surprising what tin amount of
sloping land a straight up rise of eight
inches will cover. People find themselves:
submerged almost before they are aware
of it.
DeSoto is totally deserted, even the old •
negro who climbed a tree and tooted his i
tin horn, having left. In the general
higira, it was amusing to see the freedmen
wakli-H off all aorta of craft, carrying
their chickens, bed clothes, babies and
possum dogs- The tongue of land on
which the town is situated is totally sub-
merged, and the broad waters now stretch
without obstruction from this to the Mis>
sissippi main land, a distance of about
HAIGHT & CHAMBERS’
COLOSSAL CIRCUS,
AND AMES’ NEW SOUTHERN
MENAGERIE !
three and a half miles.
The prospect is certainly an extremely
gloomy one, and in all reason we must in a
few days hear of crevasses and destruction
below here. We heard yesterday that the
levee opposite, in Madison parish, had
given way, but the information was not
posit^e. As far as we can learn the Bass
levee is all right. We tremblingly await
the next news from the Grand Levee at
Morganza, and much fear that all the rich
section of Fordoche and Atchafalay a will
witness the same scene of destruction as
was experienced by the inhabitants of
those districts this spring a year ago.
The hard rain of night before last
and yesterday has left our levee in
such a disgustingly sloshy condition,
that it is difficult even for vehicles to
make any headway.
Business, however, was tolerably
brisk, and good through freights were
shipped, but all way business is, for
the time, being, knocked in the head.

act is now a law, by approval of the
President. It authorizes a company
organized under the laws of Missouri
to construct and operate a submerged
iron tubular bridge at St. Louis, below
the bed of the channel of the Missis-
sippi ; said bridge to be a post route,
and open to the United States for all
purposes at ordinary rates; and to give
no exclusive right to any railroad, but
to be equally open to all at charges not
higher than those now made by the
ferry company.
From the Cairo Democrat of the 22d,
we obtain the following interesting
news, regarding the great flood:
THE FLOOD HERE AND ELSEWHERE.
Beyond a doubt the great flood in the
Ohio and its tributaries, which will
long characterize the year ’67 as an era
of desolation along its banks, culmin-
ated at this point yesterday. At about
sunrise the river here came to a stand
and at once commenced receding,
though but slowly as might be antici-
pated in consideration of the area of
country which it flooded on the Mis-
souri, Kentucky and Illinois shores.—
The total decline up to dark was about
three-quarters of an inch, and any
marked change in the bight of the
stream cannot be looked for for sever-
al days.
From other points we likewise hear
of the receding of the waters—from
the lands which they have taken pos-
session of, and farms and plantations,
at least in the north, will soon be re-
claimed by their former occupants.
The present flood has exceeded all
the floods known Dy me uiuusLiiinaoi-
tants, since 1847, both in the highth of
water and amount of destruction by the
angry tide. The vast expanse of wa-
ter, spread out, as it is, like a sea, ex-
tends over the low lands, and in, many
places the river is from thirty to forty
miles wide. The destruction of prop-
erty will not fall short of $3,000,000
along the Mississippi. Houses, stock,
etc., have been carried away, and min-
gled with the flood rushing wildly and
fiercely toward the Gulf of Mexico.—
The flood has damaged the planting in-
terests, and we much fear there will be
little cotton planted along the Missis-
sippi this season. Great distress has
been caused by the overflow. Planters
have been driven from their houses,
with the loss of nearly all their prop-
erty. Hundreds of worthy families
are suffering in consequence of the
flood.
The Tennessee river was fourteen
feet higher than was ever before known
and the floqd of 1867 has proved mor e
disastrous on that river than any ever
known.
