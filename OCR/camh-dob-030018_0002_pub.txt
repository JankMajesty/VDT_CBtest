English history teaches 115 that 11010
1110 111000 0٤ 1119 invasion of Britain by
1109 14111 8110 و spirit 0٤ liberty, though
subdued by 0205018 conqueringiftrmies,

Faction a recognition of its power, the
history 0٤ England 38 replete ٢1٤1
instances where the integrity 0٤ ٤109
Judiciary formed a barrier which al-
most 111000101.01191 1211010 could not
throw down 01٠ overcome-and which
preserved the liberties of 1110 10001010
and laid that foundation of the British
Government which, 11 15 strength,
justice and magnificence,challenges the
admiration of 109 world, 48 it excites
110 love 0٤ her subjects. 11000 this
fact, encouragement can be drawn 10

member that 100 090019 ever retained
their liberty 1000 1110 voluntarily
surrendered 1ا at 110 feet of ٤10 con-
querors. 1٤ is just such action that ٢111
divide 115و and weaken US and destroy
us. 1ا shows evidence of what 1
100001 did 100٤ exist—.4 casting away 0٤

that surround our 81010 0٤ state-and
is 1119 10181 surrender of every 01111 ذن-
pie of right, 1181100 ن and humanity.—

٤00 late'،' 1 think 00٤٠ 110 struggle 10
which we are now engaged is 000 between
the Spirit 0٤ Liberty and the Spirit 0٤ Fac-

“Liberty 18 ه tender plant 1101 111

lieve they yet possess 19 elements that
form the necessary nutrition,and the cour-

0 develop them. How can this be done?
“tVhenever the fundamentals 0٤ 2

gloomy night 1 Memphis has 000 num.
bered, and 40010 morning 0٤ 10114 has
dawned upon US. Really this 10اه ' 'most
foul 001 villainous” nuisance seems rather
on the increase than the subside.
اه the ineetingyesterday morning, some
time was taken up 1ا the subject 0٤
Government transportation over Railroads,
but the question was laid on ٤10 table
without any definite action.
10 vexed subject 0٤ extra baggage 38
00 introduced, and 2 very lengthy dis-
cussion ensued, finally resulting 10 the de-
cision, that 100 value 0٤ the baggage 0٤
the holder of 2 firs class ticket, should be
fixed at 8250 00, and its weight at 100
pounds. All excess of said weight 0 be
charged extra, and all excess 0 established
value 10 0 insured 0٢ owner, 0[ ٤00 at
his risk. It was also decided 10٤ a state,
ment to the above effect 09 printed 00
each ticket.
This morning, 10 business is 1101100000[-
tant, and 0٤ a nature, 1101 ٤10 represen.
tatives 0٤ h press present, have been 101
quested to leave out of ٤91 correspon-.
dence.
110 meetings have 211 090 held at 100
Gayoso, at which house there was a hop؛
last night, and a much 100019 brilliant affair
اذ was, than could have been expected, as
٤1090111001 critics say, ؛'considering ٤00 0-
tremely inauspicious state 0٤ the weather.'"
The large ballroom was thronged 1
elaborately costumed ladies, 201 011
4108501 gents, though as a matter 0٤ course,
many 0٤ thorn being 00 10 wing like ٦0٢
self, were 1111010104104 to appear in toilettes
"a labal.”
Though I will 00ا paste 1ا on 1٤100 1ا
usual stereotyped thickness of locals, اه٤
14 010000 genus,” 1 must must say there
were many lovely women present-enough
111 my opinion, to warrant the conclusion,
that in ordina weather, Memphis could
send ٤0 such an affair as this, a handsome
quota 01 lovely ladies. During the height
0 the festivities, I was called aside 0 that
ubiqitous scribbler, Harry Beck, city
0010 of the Appeal, 10 witness 20 affair,
which was quite a اهمم episode in ٤9 fes-
tivities 0٤ ٤109 evening.
Accompanying Beck to one 0٤ the 8111000-
tuous parlors of the Hotel, we there found
a large number 0٤ railroad 90100090ع,
several 0 whom were clustered around the
centre table, curiously examining a very
