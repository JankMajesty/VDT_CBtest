Memphis, March 8th, 1867.
My Dear Manlove :—Another day of)
Railroad powwowing has past—another
gloomy night in Memphis has been num1
bered, and another morning of mud has
dawned upon us. Really this latter ‘ ‘most
foul and villainous” nuisance seems rather
on the increase than the subside.
At the meeting yesterday morning, some
time was taken up with the subject of
Government transportation over Railroads,
but the question was laid on the table
without any definite action.
The vexed subject of extra baggage was
then introduced, and a very lengthy dis-
cussion ensued, finally resulting in the de-
1 cision, that the value of the baggage of
the holder of a first-class ticket, should be
will regret.
Don’t the Editor of the Herald think
it would be expedient to wait until the
“Bayonet Bill” is presented in due form
and proper shape, before we rush to accept
it?
Is not the Editor of the Herald suffer-
ing from Nigger on the Brain ?
The Herald man is engaged in the prof1
itable occupation of throwing “tubs to
the whale.”
The Editor of the Herald asserts “that
we are going through the process of emerg’
ing from the little end of the horn.” Par-
tridge goes through this operation every
day, with this difference:—Instead of
emerging from the horn, the horns are
merged in him—or in other words he gets
on the outside of them.
Does the Editor of the Herald favor
negro suffrage ?
What is the position of the Herald, in
the present emergency ?
Wb lay before our readers this morning,
a communication from another distinguish’
ed soldier in the armies of the Confederate
States, and commend it to their special
attention. The people of this State must
be united.

lett, in this morning’s issue.

the spirit of Faction — while even i
measures are now being taken to bring i
this Military Bill before the Supreme :
Court for decision, shall we step for-
ward, our eyes upturned and our knees
quaking to the “ coming man,” as the
Persian regards the rising sun, and say
you needn’t decide this question, here
we are—take us and bind us—and we
will wear the chains you impose, for
we not deserve liberty. Out upon
such conduct. No people upon earth
ever yet lived,^>r ever will live, who
enjoyed liberty when they were will-
ing to be slaves. Such conduct, while
it cannot fail to tinge the cheek of
every calm thinking and patriotic man
in the lafrd, either with shame or with
pity, cannot fail to excite among our
enemies, contempt, and among the
world, distrust of us. It does seem to
me that the advice of keep cool! keep
cool! which they so freely offer to those
who differ from them, should be prac-
ticed first a little by themselves.—
While they are making locomotive
speed “ to rest in Abraham’s bosom”—
while they stretch out their arms and
invite the shackles which our enemies
would bind on all—they look back and
say keep cool ! Ah! we could, Mr.
Editor, keep perfectly cool if we only
knew that they alone would be the ones
, upon whom the chains would be rivet-
> ed. But when it is a whole people, in-
i stead of themselves only, for one I will
, enter my solemn protest against «uch
. action.
English history teaches us that from
the time of the invasion of Britain by
the Gauls, the spirit of liberty, though
subdued by Catsar’s conqueringHrmies,
was not entirely eradicated. And
while one can point to many instances
in which it maintained itself by force |
of arms, and wrung from tyrannous
Faction a recognition of its power, the
history of England is replete with
instances where the integrity of the
Judiciary formed a barrier which al-
most uncontrolled Faction could not
throw down or overcome—and which
preserved the liberties of the people
and laid that foundation of the British
Government which, in its strength,
j ustice and magnificence,challenges the
admiration of the world, as it excites
the love of her subjects. From this
fact, encouragement can be drawn for
our firm, united and dignified action
in the crisis now existing. Let us re-
member that no people ever retained
their liberty when they voluntarily
surrendered it at the feet of the con-
querors. It is just such action that will
divide us, and weaken us and destroy
us. It shows evidence of what I
hoped did not exist—a casting away of
all the anchors of our safety—of all
hopes of the influence, if not the su-
premacy, of the constitutional barriers
that surround our ship of State—and
is the total surrender of every princi-
ple of right, justice and humanity.—
If it is believed that the spirit of lib-
erty is crushed and bleeding, and dead
beyond all hope of a resurrection, then
can I imagine the influences that guide I
, the advocates of such a cause. But if
they do not so believe, if they have
; any hope of the existence of republi-
. can liberty in the land ; then I take it
they not only give evry bad advice, set
a very bad example and exert a very
bad influence, but that they are spread-
ing their sails to caj^i the passing
breeze which they hope may favor
them. Giving to every man credit for
integrity of motive in his action in
this-case, their apolopy is best found
in the words, “ they take counsel of I
their fears.” I have been surprised
to see men of reputation ; men, who by
their (too partial perhaps) friends,have
been considered “as wondrous wise,” I
following in the wake of “Joe Brown,
of Georgia,” a man who, during the
war, advised and spoke and acted
against the cause he propossed to es-
pouse, and who, now, when the clouds
lowers and the heavens theaten, feel-
ingly professes his sympathy, while
he urges them to invite the fate that
strips them of their freedom, and
clothes them in the worst slavery.—
Such a man and such men as pattern
after him, are not safe counselors for a
free people. They are like the weath-
er cocks that change with every pass-
ing breeze. It is so much like the old
spirit of ’60 and ’61—which said “sign
the roll boys, I’m going to be with
you,” and then hade them good-bye at I
the cars—that I’m afraid of it, and I
would shun it as I would him, who
having deceived me once, I would not
trust again. But do not understand
me as counseling resistance by force.
If I felt that way, the little sense I
have would show me the folly and the
wrong, and the utter madness of such
a course. But I do think that we ought
to submit, not with that rushing haste
and wild impetuosity which a slavish
spirit would espouse, but with a digni-
ty of action, a sense of the degradation
our enemies would impose upon us, an
intelligent manifestation of our rights
and duties which, by birth, education
and the spirit of liberty, have been in-
stilled in us from our youth up. If we
have any self respect remaining, let us
keep it out of the market, and don’t let
it be sold with our liberties. Let us
have no running forward to meet half
way the chains whose clanking so
many hear. Let us have no servility
of action. No baseness of demeanor
towards our conquerors. In submit-
ting to their rule, it is not necessary to
kiss the rod that smites us. Mytholo-
serve to himself the power to create
man, determined among themselves to
make a woman, on whom each of
them should bestow a gift. One be-
stowed music, another wisdom, anoth-
er beauty, and another eloquence ; and .
they called her name Pandora, which -
signifies gifts from all. Jupiter, pre-
tending that he wished to bestow some- ,
thing upon her, presented her with a
closed box and desired her to take it
to Prometheus ; who, fearing treachery
refused to receive either her or the box
—but another, more foolish, received
both—married Pandora and opened
the box, from which escaped immedi-
ately all the evils and crimes that have
since deluged the world. Hope alone
remained, to comfort humanity. And
when hope takes its flight from among
the children of men, they are shorn of
the last possession that makes life en-
durable or worth struggling for—the
last strand of the cord connecting the
past with the present is severed, and
we can but struggle with the evils
which our own folly will have brought
upon us.
I confess that I cling to hope; hope
of better days, a better time when the
principles of republican liberty will
triumph over a faction, and when the
; disease that now preys on the body pol-
■ itic, may be cured by the caustic of a
- purifying process which the nation is
1 now undergoing. And believing
strongly in this hope, I believe that the
spirit of liberty should be cultivated
incessantly “in good report and evil
too”—“for, the spirit of liberty, far
from inspiring that rashness and un-
distinguishing fury which are peculiar
to the spirit of faction, is now to act
even against the worst of rulers, and
exerts itself in favor of the best with
more effect than any other spirit what-
soever, and no matter how slowly it
may act in suspicious times,and against
encroaching Governors, yet, if it be
kept alive, it will act sooner or later,
though under the greatest disadvan-
tages and against the most powerful
opposition.”
CLAIBORNE COUNTY.
[communicated.]	I
Mw Editor—I have watched with a 1
great deal of anxiety the course th lit would 1
bo pursued by the press of our State in
I the event that has occurred by the passage
of the Military Bill. If the issue that this
event forces upon the country—if the prin-
ciples involved in its application, and the
material interests depending upon its solu-
tion, were not of such a character as to ex-s
cite our greatest anxiety and to demand
the most careful consideration upon our
part, it would be amusing to witness the
somersaults it has occasioned and the ter-
giversations it has produced. I hoped that
the press of our Stlte, as well as the peo-
ple, whose weal or whose woe is so greatly
involved by this “terrible law,” would be
a unit in feeling and a unit in action. The
old principle of “united we stand, divided
we fall,” applied to the States under the
Constitution, has to us of the South now,
a signification as deep and a fate as por-
tentous for good or for evil, as its observ-
ance or disregard ever had to the Ameri-
can people as a nation. We are now on
the verge of a terrible chasm. Behind us
defeat and desolation, beneath us the dis-
grace and degradation of all we hold dear,
and beyond us is a land like unto the
promised Canaan. We cannot retrace our
steps. A step forward, and down we go—
away down to the bottomless pit of despair,
in which no ray of light or hope will illume
the blackness of a nation’s sad disgrace
and death. What then are we to do?
Shall we not make an effort to bridge this
chasm, and reach that position where we
can rest in safety? One thing is certain;
out of our present condition must we
emerge cither as the veriest slaves, or with I
the air of freedom, purer, lighter and more 1
healthful than this nation has breathed it i
since the clanking chains of Great Britain
were struck from the limbs of the young
Republic. A division of sentiment among
our own people, leading to diversity of ac-
tion on their part, will, I firmly believe,
but fasten on us the terrible chains of a
most revolting slavery. If we remain firm,
1 single in purpose and united in action, we
’ may emerge from the crisis that now sur'
' rounds us with our liberties firmly re-
stored, our rights guaranteed, and our
escutcheon untarnished. How can we
bridge tliis chasm, and reach the position
of safety ? The only question is, is it yet
too late i I think not- The struggle in
which we are now engaged is one between
the Spirit of Liberty and the Spirit of Fac-
tion.
“Liberty is a tender plant which will
not flourish unless the genius of the soil be
proper for it. Nor will any soil continue
to be so long, which is not cultivated with
incessant care. Mischiefs of various kinds
abound, and there is no season in the rev-
olution of the great political year of gov-
ernment when we can say, with truth, that
liberty is entirely free from immediate
or remote danger. ” In the case now be-
fore us, Liberty is in immediate danger
from the Spirit of Faction, which ignores
the national good and the national inter-
ests in the pursuit of personal aggrandize-
ment and personal feelings. For one, I
am not so lost to all hope as to believe
that the Spirit of Faction, that now wages
in our Congress such a terrible warfare,
has strangled all resistance, or squeezed
the life out of the Spirit of Liberty in this
nation. I believe that “she is not dead,
but sleepeth,” and that in the might of
her giant strength, animated by the love
of a pure government and a free people,
she will yet shake off the terrible night-
mare of a bloody faction that now oppresses
the nation. But the soil in which this
spirit lives must be cultivated with inces-
sant care. The Spirit of Liberty must be
roused from the lethargy that oppresses
her. The people of the South is the soil
in which this spirit has lived, and I be-
lieve they yet possess the elements that
form the necessary nutrition,and the cour-
age, the constancy and devotion necessary
to develop them. How can this be done?
“Whenever the fundamentals of a
free government are attacked, or any
other schemes ruinous to the general in-
terests ofra nation are pursued, the best
service that can be rendered to such a
nation, is to commence an early and vigor1
ous opposition to them, for the event will
always show that those who form an oppo-
sition in this manner, are the truest friends
to the nation, however they may be stig-
matized at first with odious names, which
belong more properly to those who throw
the dirt at them.”
One branch of the Government has
usurped to itself the functions of all. Not
only arc our own liberties threatened, our
rights disregarded, but the whole people,
the entire nation has before it the prospect
of a fate as terrible. If “history repeats
itself,” and I have read it to any purpose,
I have learned that governments are over-
thrown and liberty swept away, when the
people, as well as the rulers, have reached
that position when corruption is not only
tolerated but defended, as a necessary ad-
junct of the government, and when faction
controls the entire government. Yet here
we have, out of three co-ordinate branches
of the government, “the dependence of
all resulting from t ie independence of
each,” but one branch, (the legislation,)
which has run riot with faction, and which
openly invades the liberties of the people.
Do the advocates of the new order of things
and the obsequious apologists here among
us,pretend to say that the laws of Congress,
like those of the English Parliament, have
the samtity of the supremacy of the State?
Do they not know that there is a President
and Supreme Court, forming two’thirds
of the power of the Government against
the one-third power in the interests of
faction? Do they not know that the pub-
lic acts of the one and the decisions of the
other upon questions of principle ingrafted
in this very “Military Bill,” point directly
a course precisely opposed to the one

pounds. All excess of said weight to be (
charged extra, and all excess of established
value to be insured by owner, or taken at .
his risk. It was also decided that a state’
nient to the above effect be printed on
each ticket.
This morning, the business is unimpor-
tant, and of a nature, which the represen'
tatives of the press present, have been rei
quested to leave out of their correspon-.
dence.
The meetings have all been held at the
Gayoso, at which house there was a hop,
last night, and a much more brilliant affair
it was, than could have been expected, as
theatrical critics say, “considering the ex-
tremely inauspicious state of the weather. ’ ’
The large balbroom was thronged with
elaborately costumed ladies, and well
dressed gents, though as a matter of course,
many of them being on the wing like my.
self, were unprepared to appear in toilettes
“a la bal.”
Though I will not paste it on with the
usual stereotyped thickness of locals, “et
id omue genus,” I must must say there
were many lovely women present—enough
in my opinion, to warrant the conclusion,
that in ordinary weather, Memphis could
send to such an affair as this, a handsome
quota of lovely ladies. During the height
of the festivities, I was called aside by that
ubiqitous scribbler, Harry Beck, city
editor of the Appeal, to witness an affair,
which was quite a neat episode in the fes-
tivities of the evening.
Accompanying Beck to one of the sump-
! tuous parlors of the Hotel, we there found
a large number of railroad gentlemen,
several of whom were clustered around the
r centre table, curiously examining a very
splendid watch and chain. On having ]
been permitted to take a nearer view of
the timepiece. I found inscribed on its .
cap: “Presented toE. B. Byington, Esq., :
General Passenger Agent, St. Louis Pack-
et Line, by his Railroad friends in atteni
dance at the General Ticket Agents Con-
vention, Memphis, Tenn., March 7th,
1867.” Mr. Byington having been called
forward, a list of facetious charges were
preferred against him, by Mr. C. N. Pratt,
and the watch presented to him in the
shape of a penalty, for his uniform good
conduct, and business capability. The
presentation was unique and neat, and Mr.
B. replied with considerable brevity and
feeling, appearing to have reached that
point, at which “the heart speaks most,
when the lips move not.” Previous to
this, I had presented a letter of introduc-
tion from our friend W. M. Williams, Esq.,
of river fame, to Mr. Byington, and ’tis
unnecessary to say that I met with a cor-
dial reception, and found him a thorough
gentleman.
The Convention has just adjourned,
(Hi a. m.,) to meet at the International
Hotel, Niagara Falls, on the 2d Wednes-
day of October next.
They have concluded their business much
sooner than I anticipated, but through the
whole Convention, I have been struck with
the vigorous rail road style, in which
things are managed' There will be a gen’
eral scattering this evening, and the ma-
jority of the crowd will go to New Orleans.
Business here is not by any means ac>
tive, and not bonsidering the condition of
the streets, (which are simply horrible,)
there is at present a sort of hiatus between
the winter and spring trade, which induces
an evident dullness.
The Railroad between this and Little
Rock is progressing ; but the work has
been somewhat impeded by high water.
The snort of the iron horse will be heard
in DeSoto, ere it is in Hopefield.
There a community of interest between
Memphis and Vicksburg, which should be
fostered in every manner which is calcu-
lated to yield mutual benefits.
There is talk here of a new line of steam’
ers between our city and St. Louis. I am
confident such a line would pay.
One of the best institutions I have yet
seen here is the chain-gang. It is a fine
idea, and productive of much good ; if our
able-bodied vagrants were compelled to
work out their fines, at 50 cents per diem,
(the rate established here,) a cleaner city
would be the result, though I must say,
even as it is, we surpass Memphis in this
particular.
The Mexican Opera Troupe open here
to-night. Signora Cattarina, Signora To>
wasi, &c.
I shall leave this evening at five, with
the New Orleans crowd, and will “turn
up” at the Times office, shortly after this,
unless I am prevailed upon by the gay and
. festive crew, to accompany them to the
Crescent City. There is a tide, and several
railroads and steamboats in the affairs of
men, and I don’t know yet which to take.
I am at the Overton. Chanfrau is here,
but have heard nothing of Vestvali.
Until we meet, adieu,
HARRY MOSS.

OPENING OF SPRING TRADE I
MEYER & KAHN
Would INFORM THEIR FRIENDS OF VICKSBU8G AND VICINITY, THAT THEY
HAVE RECEIVED THEIR
Hl,761 27
The receipts of the year from March 1st
1866, to March 1st, 1867, for the sale of Gas,
Coke and Coal Tar, amounted to $31,587 35;
the expenses during the same period, includ-
ing the salaries of officers, wages of laborers,
consumption of Coal and Lime in Gas making
and incidental expenses, amounted to $22,-
294 07, making the net receipts $9,293 38.—
For the past year the Company received for
the City and Jail lamps, $6,509 60, while the
year previous they received $9,345 50, making
a difference of $2,835 90.
The total amount of Gas made during the
year was 7,148,700 cubic feet. The loss by
leakage and condensation, has been 1,037,900.
On the 1st of March, 1866, there were 230
private consumers and 133 public lamps; at
the present time there would have been 294
meters in use by private consumers and 135
public lamps'. This shows an increase of 64
private consumers and 2 public lamps. Loss
by fires 42—leaving, at this date, 252 private
consumers.
Before the suspension of the works June,
1862, the highest number of private consum-
ers was 250. As soon as the burnt district is
rebuilt the consumption of Gas will again in-
crease; the contemplated extension on Mul-
berry street, with five new lamp posts, will

The following is a synopsis of the latest
news in regard to the stage of the upper riv-
ers.
At Cincinnati and Louisville, the Ohio was
was rising about an inch per hour.
At Nashville, the Cumberland was swelling
two inches per hour.
The Richmond.—A magnificent boat
has been built at Madison, Indiana—fin-
ished, or rather furnished, at Louisville,
Ky., which is to be called the “Richmond' ’
in honor of the Virginian metropolis The
Richmond Enquirer gives the following
description of her-
The Richmond is the largest boat ever
launched upon the Western waters, being
considerably larger than the Ruth, which
has hitherto been. considered the mam-
moth of the Mississippi.
Her extreme length is 340 feet, and her
model, fore and aft, the keenest of any
ever built, being similarrin every respect,
to the old “Sultana,” of Louisville, the
fastest boat that ever turned a wheel.
She is built on the low pressure prineb
nle, being the only boat of the kind ever
launched in the West, and on the plan of
the Daniel Drew, and other Hudson river
clippers. Her cylinder are 72 inches in
diameter, and with a pressure of only
thirty pounds to the square inch, hardly
enough to break an egg shell—will stem
the mighty current of the Mississippi at a
speed of fifteen miles per hour, making
the trip from Louisville to New Orleans in
four and halfdays. She hrs a beam of 50
feet and a depth of 9 feet.
Her staterooms are the largest ever
placed on a boat, those in the forward cabi^
being six by twelve feet, and those in the
adies cabin being seven by twelve, each
room being furnished with a bedstead,
chairs, a table, etc., and the staterooms
are connected by doors, in a manner which
allows them to be thrown into suits of
rooms.
On the deck aft, is an observatory, fif-
teen feet high, enclosed, built entirely of
frames and sash work, accessible by a
stairway from the ladies cabin, and spa1
cious enough to accommodate forty per-
sons.
Adjoining the nusury, is a cabin for
negroes, and the entire accommodations
are gotten up in a style, and with a mag-
nificence unequalled in steamboat annals.
She is said to be the best, swiftest and
safest boat on the western waters.
The Enquirer should have added that
she is being built, and will be commanded
by one of the. cleverest and most successful
steamboatman on our Western and South1
ern streams, J. Stut Neal, the present
popular master of the Indiana.

The following is from the Haversack
for March:
At the battle of Kinston, the Junior
Reserves (made up of lads under 18) were
sent to force the crossing of South* West
Creek and drive the enemy away, to make
good the passage of other troops. This
they Lid very handsomely, but encounter1
ing a severe fire, a portion of one regi-
ment sought a safer place. As they were
streaming to the rear, they met the Ala-
bama boys and were greeted with shouts
of laughter. A. general officer, in no
laughing mood at their behavior, took
steps to stop the disorder and with his
own hands seized one of the fugitives.
General. “What are you running
for?" .
Junior. . “Oh, General, the Yankees
were shooting at us?”
General. “Why didn’t you shoot back
again? Aint you ashamed of yourself?
You are crying like a baby.”
Junior. (Blubbering) “I wish I was a
baby. Oh ! I wish I was a gal baby!”

We have seen a letter from Mr. Barnett,
Postmaster at Vicksburg^ to our Postmas1
ter at Natchez Mr. Broun, which very
satisfactorily. explains . the delay of our
mails in coming and going through Vicks-
burg. The mails which leave here Sunday
and Wednesday nights, are not received in
the Postofiice at Vicksburg, until about 8
o’clock Tuesday and Friday mornings—one
hour too late to be forwarded by the mail
trains at 7 o’clock, even if they could be
got ready. So also the mails for this place
are unavoidably delayed. They arrive by
rail in Vicksburg at a quarter past 6 P. M-
and the schedule time for the boats to
leave is 5 p. M. So that mail matter ar-
riving in Vicksburg Friday evening, has to
remain there until Monday night, certain-
ly, and unless brought by the Quitman,
which is under no contract to bring it, has
to wait for the Magenta, the regular maih
boat of Tuesday af ternoon. In the same
way a letter sent from Jackson Tuesday
arrived in Vicksburg too late for the mail
boat that afternoon, and has to lie over
until the next mail boat leaves Friday af-
ternoon.—[Natchez Democrat,
