C
It is not to be supposed that a country
whose industrial system has been destroyed,
and which has been torn and desolated by
all the furies that follow in the footsteps
of war, can readily command the capital
whereby to build upon a new foundation
and restore its prosperity., Money is pro*
verbially cautious. Even if It were not, it
would be strange if it should readily seek
employment in communities which offer
the feeble safeguards that have existed in
the Southern States since the close of the
war. '	... .'
The Legislature of Mississippi, at its
last session, was wisely prompted by this
consideration in the. passage of a law
(which has been published in these col-
umns, and to which, in view of its impor-
tance, we would again direct special atten-
tion,) entitled “an act for the encourage-
ment of agriculture.”
The first section of the act provides that
all debts hereafter contracted for advances
of money, purchase of supplies, farming
utensils, working stock, or other things
necessary for the cultivation of a farm or
plantation, shall constitute a PRIOR lien
upon the products of such farm or plantax
tion, which are not by law exempt from
sale by virtue of execution; and also upon
the animals, implements, &c., employed
in cultivating the same, which shall have
been purchased with the mdney so ad-
vanced.
The second section provides that when-
ever any owner or lessee of a plantation
shall make any contract with laborers for
its cultivation, for a share of the crop, and
shall make advances of money, provisions,
or clothing, the said owner or lessee shall
have a lien on the said share for the pay-
ment of his advances.
The third section provides that all con-
tracts under this act shall be filed in the
office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court of
the county in which the plantation is sitw
ated.
The fourth section provides that pro-
ceedings to enforce such lien shall be by
bill in Chancery; and they shall be com-
menced within six months after the debt
becomes due.
The fifth section provides that on the
filing of the bill, the clerk shall issue a writ
of sequestration commanding the proper
officer to take into his possession the prop1
erty liable to seizure, and hold it until the
further order of the Court, or until the
defendant shall enter into bond to have the
property forthcoming to abide its decree.
The bond shall be returned with the writs,
and in case the property shall not be forth1
coming, it shall have the effect of a judg-
ment. If the bond be not given in twen-
ty days after levy, the Court shall order
the sale of the property, for cash, or place
it in the hands of a receiver for just and
equitable disposition..
Section sixth prohibits the levying
on, or selling by virtue of an execu-
tion or other process, any crop of cot-
ton, corn, &c., while the same is under
cultivation and before it is matured ;
but does not prevent an attachment
for rent against a non-resident or ab-
sconding debtor, from being levied on
the said crop.
Section seven provides that it shall
be lawful to convey by way of mort-
gage or deed of trust any agricultural
product within fifteen months from
the date of such mortgage—such mort-
gage, however, shall not interfere with
any previous lien created by virtue of
this act.
Such are the main features of the
law. It will be seen that it affords
ample security to the capitalist who
may desire a profitable investment for
his money. The remedy is prompt,
simple and effective, in case the bor-
rower fails to discharge his obligation.
Capitalists heretofore have been de-
terred from affording to planters the
necessary facilities for making crops,
apprehensive that they would be
seized as soon as gathered, to satisfy
former judgments; but' the first sec-
tion of the act creating a prior lien
in their favor obviates this difficulty.
To the producer, tfie law cannot fail
to prove beneficial. It is nothing but
just that he who furnishes the accommo-
dations requisite for the raising of a erop,
should hold, as a preferred creditor, the
first claim upon it. When the storm of
war swept almost every species of property
from the land, creditors found it by no
means difficult to hoard their notes and
other evidences of debt, which, on the re-
turn of peace, have crawled like vipers
from their frozen beds, to annoy and tor-
ment the already anguished and suffering
masses. These creditors, many ok whom
are grasping speculators—“grinders of
poor men’s fac^”—should be made to
stand aside, at least until the people. have
obtained forthemselves the means of living.
There are many planters who have com1
menced their operations for the year with
inadequate supplies, in the hope that some
kind wind would blow upon the sails they
have spread, and carry them safely into
port. The wise man has said that “time
and chance happeneth to all.” They
should improve the opportunity which this
measure affords; and the merchant should
relax, if in his power, the rigor he has
hitherto practised towards the planter. If
the producing classes are not aided in
throwing off the Old Man of the Sea, all ■
must go to the bottom together.

Washington, Feb. 28.—During a de-

of falsehood in his statement ok inability
to secure revenue officers in the South who
were able to take the test oath. Sherman
passionately retorted to Sumner’s langu-
age, saying that it was neither Parliament
tar? or gentlemanly, but false. Chandler
echoed to Sumner in epithets which were
characterized by Fesenden as foul-mouth i
ed abuse.
The scene grew out of the amendment
striking out pay of Southern officers.

An INTERESTING QUESTION.
What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those anected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease than those possessed of strong and
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition? We answer, by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic,
HOOFLAND’S
GERMAN BITTERS,
PREPARED BY
Dr. C. M. JACKSON,
PHILADELPHIA.
This Bitters is a compound ef fluid extracts.
■The roots and herbs from which it is made are
gathered in Germany, and their virtues, in the
form of extracts, extracted by one of the most
scientific chemits and pharmaceutists this coun-
try affords. It is
NOT A LIQUOR PREPARATION,
in any sense of the word; contains no whisky,
rum, or any other intoxicating ingredients, ana
can be freely used in families without any fear
or risk of those using it contracting the disease
or vice of intemperance. We wish this fact
distinctly understood, as many others before
the public are prepared from liquor of some kind.
During the
CHOLERA SEASON
of 1849, this Bitters were extensively used
througnout the entire country
AS A PREVENTIVE,
and we have not heard of a single instance in
which this Bitters was used, where the persons
suffered from any of the symptoms of Cholera.

Philadelphia, April 28,1866.~
I consider “Hoofland’s German Bitters” a
valuable medicine in case of an attack of Indi-
gestion or Dyspepsia. I can certify this from
my experience in it.
Yours, with respect,
JAMES THOMPSON,
Judge of the Supreme Court of Penn’a.
From A. McMakin, Esq., New York, No. 668
^Broadway, March 29,1886.
Dear Sir—I take great pleasure in testifying
to the extraordinary remedial qualities of the
Hoofland’s German Bitters, procured at your
establishment.
A member of the family has been for many
years a perfect Martyr to Dyspepsia, Palpita-
tion of the Heart, and other distressing off-
spings ol a torpid liver, until persuaded to try
the above celebrated remedy, which in a few
weeks resulted in making her (to use her own
words) “anew woman.”
You are at liberty to make any use of this you
see fit, or refer similar sufferers to
Yours, truly, A. McMAKIN.
“Oh, pa, Mr. Smith was here this
morning, and when ma told him that you
would not be home till late, he said her
lips were like honey, and that he wished
he was a bee, and then he kissed her.
They gave me a stick of candy not to tell
any one, but I don’t think they’d mind
you, you are so well acquainted with ma.”

I have knowh Hoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably for a number of years. I have used
them in my own family, and have been so
pleased witn their effects that I was induced to
recommend them to many others, and know
that they have operated in strikingly benefi-
cial manner. I take great pleasure in thus pub-
licly proclaiming this fact, and calling the at-
tention of those affiicted with the diseases for
which they are recommended, to this Bitters,
knowing from experience that my recommend-
ation will be sustained. I do this more cheer-
fully as Hoofland’s Bitters is intended to benefit
the affiicted, and is not a “rum drink.”
