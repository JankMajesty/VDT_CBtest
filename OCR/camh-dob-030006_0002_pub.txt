VICKSBURG DAILY TIMES
OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY.
T. B. MANLOVE, HARRY MOSS,
Editors.
TUESDAY MORNING, Feb. 26, 1867,
^^For Telegraph see First Page
Mr. John Lee, Route Agent on the South-
ern Railroad, is the duly authorized agent of
the Times to receive subscriptions, and collect
the moneys due therefor.
Notice.
Postmasters, or others, who will send us 5
subscribers to the Weekly, or 10 to the
Daily, accompanied with the cash, will re-
ceive a copy of the paper gratis for one year.
New Presses and Type, from the most
celebrated Foundries in the United States,
and the best workmen in the State, at the
Vicksburg Times Job Office.
We are indebted to the accommoda-
ting and efficient agent of the South-
ern Express, Mr. John T. O’Brien, fol-
iate papers.
We have received a communication from
a large number of our most reliable busi-
ness men, offering a large reward for the
apprehension of certain parties engaged in
horse-stealing. Any one arresting or giv>
ing information which will lead to the de
tection of these scoundrels, will receive
$200 for each one. The names of the
signers can be seen on application at this
office.
Gen. R. E. Toombs, of Georgia, once
Secretary of State of the late (so-called)
Confederacy, is in New Orleans, at the St.
James.
It is a shameful fact that the tele-
gram announcing the passage of the
Military Bill reached the New Orleans
papers,—was published in them,—and
those papers came to Vicksburg by
the regular course of mail, before the
news could be disseminated among
the citizens of this community, through
their own papers.
The papers, in this place, pay a very
heavy weekly telegraph bill, and the
parties from whom they receive it,
took the contract with the understand-
ing that the Vicksburg press was to
be furnished with the latest and most
reliable news from all quarters.
In this instance, a most flagrant
wrong has been committed, and we,
for one, raise our voice in favor of
rescinding the contract with the par-
ties who are now sending telegraphic
reports, and of employing some other
company; or, failing in this, to stop
them altogether, until some arrange-
ment can be made by which Vicks-
burg will not be thus left several days
behind -the times.
A few more days and old winter will
have been shoved off the stage of exist-
ence, by young and lovely spring, which
this year is a season frieghted with many
hopes and many fears.
Aside from the political embarrassments
surrounding us at this particular juncture,
our domestic affairs and relations are in a
situation which causes uneasiness to the
merchant and the planter, whose interests
are so nicely dovetailed, and so much in
common with each other that it is almost
impossible to seperate them, for on the
success of the latter depends in a very
great degree the prosperity of the former.
It behooves them, each of these seper-
ate yet closely allied classes to understand
each other thoroughly and to make such
fair and honest concessions as will redound
to the benefit of each in their respective
spheres.
The planter whenever it is possible for
him to do so, should liquidate as far as lies
in his power the outstanding claims of the
past year, and the merchant should evince
a disposition to be as lenient in his exac-
tions as the nature of the case will permit.
We predict that this season will be an
auspicious one to the planter, merely on
the hypothesis that two unfavorable years
have rarely been known to come together,
but to be on the safe side, the mistake
which was made last year in endeavoring
to cultivate too much ground in cotton,
should be carefully avoided, and if our
pockets are not filled with greenbacks, we
shall at least have enough of the staff of
life, if an abundance of grain and cereals
are planted. The political situation is one
of peculiar moment and excitement. Dis^
patches have arrived from Washington
City announcing the passage of the Mili-
tary Bill and the conversion of our State
into a Territory.
This intelligence instead of discourag-
ing us, or prostrating our energies, should
only strengthen the determination to live
within ourselves—in a few words- it only
proves that we can expect no favors from
the dominant party, and it therefore only
remains for us to make our mon bread and
meat, and eat it.
The failure of the secret mission of the
steamer Gettysburg, with Frederick Sew-
ard and Admiral Porter aboard, has leaked
out in ffiis wise : The intention was to
purchase the island of St. Domingo for a
coaling station- PresidentCobreal thought
the plan a good one, but demanded cash
down and plenty of it. A large amount of
specie was put aboard, but at Port Royal
Jamacia, the sailors broke into the Ward
room, where it was stored, and abstracted
three bags of it and deserted the ship with
their booty. A reward of one hundred
dollars being offered for the recovery of the
money, the search for the thieves was
very brisk, and one of them was caught
with a portion of it in his possession. He
was turned over to the First Lieutenant,
who, it is said, compassionately returned
the money to him and sent him ashore.—
Thus the missionaries had not money
enough to purchase St. Domingo, and
after recuperating their health at Nassau,

VICKSBURG TIMES, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 18 6 7.
VESTVALI AND WE.
vidide and vicide 'em so quick,
they yielded up to Rome, in less
than it would take the Legisla-
of Mississippi to pass a stay-law,
the
Vestvali came to Vicksburg last
week. Cresar went to Gaul, because
the gaul darned Gauls were fairly
itching for a licking, and he venide,
and
that
time
ture
and swore they'd roam no more.
Mahomet went to the mountain, be-
cause the mountain politely declined
to get down off its dignity and come
to Mahomet.
Vestvali came to Vicksburg, be-
cause John Templeton went to New
Orleans, and shook a big roll of green-
backs at her in an imploring attitude.
The people of Vicksburg went to
the theater to see Vestvali, by a ma-
jority of two-thirds, because they had
heard she was a good egg.
We went to the Washington Hotel
to see Vestvali, because she sent for us
by a peremptory waiter.
We were also prepared to see a good
egg, but we trembled in our boots at
the magnitude of the oviparous spe-
cimen before us.
She advanced toward us with a stride
as graceful as an iron-clad gunboat in
its native element, and enthusiastically
seizing our fairy-like hand, she ex-
claimed in a stentorian, melo-dramati-
cal tragical voice fully five feet deep,
" Thou art the erudite and festive
youth which scribblest about the
drama for the Vicksburg Times, art
thou not ?” We replied in a weak and
feeble tone, " We art.” “Then,” said
she, " canst thou scribble largely,” and
we replied, " Furnish us with the lead
pencils and the cocktails, oh! colossal
maiden, and we canstest by the yard
and she stamped her large, imperious
foot till the window-sash rattled in
their sockets, and exclaimed, "A truce
to thy cocktails, base minion of the
press,” what thinkest thou of That di-
vine fluid, the ordinary appellation of
which is champagne.
Our mouth immediately commenced
to go whickatywhack, and we shouted
" oh! mammoth queen of tragedy, this
base minion of the press deems
it a disgraceful blot on the proud
escutcheon of his profession, for any
member of it to be discovered in
act of refusing that much abused, but
extremely useful article.”
Her brow darkened—her lip quiv-
ered—her face flushed—her teeth grit-
ted—her eye-balls glared—her nose
curled—and her heaving bosom rose
and fell at the rate of two feet and a
half every twenty-four hours,—and we
crawled under the center-table. An
expression of mingled determination
and defiance played around her classic
mouth, and rested for several consecu-
tive seconds in the abstruse creases of
her superfluous chin. Rising a few
indefinite feet fuller than the full
height of her more than majestic pro-
portions, she right obliqued three
paces, placed one hand upon her left
hip, and raising her right foot aloft in
a supplicating attitude, she rang the
bell, and retained that picturesque
position for three quarteisof an hour,
exclaiming at stated intervals, "What,
ho, without there,” when a dark freed-
man entered with a spade, and in-
formed Vestvali that there was no "ho
without there,” but that he had been
so fortunate as to procure the above
implement, which he hoped would
answer her purpose for the present.
A loud smile rushed over her coun-
tenance, like a steamboat wave, and
she exclaimed, "ha, ha, ha, I speak
not of agricultural implements, but
get thee hence, as fast as thy huge
extremities can carry thee, and bring
hither enough champagne for a dozen
common men—yet stay—hold—be
certain that 'tis of the brand called
Heidsick, or I will so chastise thee, as
to make thy swarthy Aidfe-sick.
Thirteen quart bottles of Heidsick
soon appeared upon the scene, and
placing her arms akimbo, she cried—
"Base minion of the press, hast thou
a corkscrew,” and we answered,
"Huge traggicker—we were never
known to flicker on a corkscrew—be-
hold—one which many a hundred
time and oft, has drewed the spark-
ling cork from the foaming wine—but
in this connection why dost thou call
us " Base minion,”—thou woundest
our tenderest sensibilities, for we are
a portion of that lever which moves
the world.”
Vestvali was evidently struck by the
sublime peroration of our last remark, for
she commenced to weep, and while she
was wepting, she blubbered profusely, and
sobbed to some extent, but dashing aside
her manly tears with a ferocious gesture,
she said, “I crave thy pardon, oh f diminu-
tive lever, and whenever thou succeedest
in moving anything in this world bigger
than Vestvali, then write me a letter to
the care of John Vestvali, Sr., Cracow,
Poland, the land of the brave and the
home of this magnificent traggicker.”
Pausing for a moment in a Hamlet’s so*
liloquy attitude, she continued--“Tis
past—parley no longer on frivolous mat-
ters, but apply thy editorial corkscrew, to
two of the quart bottles before thee, and
fill high the sparkling goblets, ere I kick
thee, as I have full many a time and oft
kicked a supernumerary in a one horse
theatre.”
We obeyed iu silence—our flowing bow's
were filled to the brim, and for the space of
one hour, not a sound could be heard,
save the echo of the champagne, as it
sought the cavernous abiding places, of
our human systems. When the delicious
fluid began to circulate through our colla-
teral viens, we grew bold apace, and rising
the wall, we remarked by way of a toast,
“Here’s to Vestvali—the great eastern of
all traggickers,” and we would have pre
ceeded at length fo say, “may & etc.,
meet with that reward, &c.” but the bright
colors of the parlor carpet, dazzled out-
eyes, and caused our feet to slide from
under us, and we said, instead of the
above, “made the children laugh and
play, to see a lamb at school.' ’
Boldly maintaining a sitting position on ;
the floor, we requested Vestvali toaddress
a few soothing remarks to us in her own
dear soft Italian language, and nodding to
us a cheerful acquiescence, she assumed a
position directly in front of us, and stoop-
ing down, she put her left hand upon
her knee, and pointing directly at us,
with her right fore-finger, while her ex-
pressive countenance rippled with sunny
uniles, she said—archee kutchee kutchee
kutehee kutchee kutchee kutchee—archee
kutchee kutchee kutchee.
“Oh! enchanting language” we cried,
“why wert us not born an Italiker, so
that we could also speak in Italics,” and
we asked Vestvali if all the Italickers
spoke the language as enormously as she
did, and whether they all grew to such a
fluent size as herself, and she said-, “they
do’est speak the language which is the
result of their own sunny skies, but my
present dimensions are the result of an
accident. When I was but a little child,
—one day—ah! I remember it well—
’twas a lovely day in the month of July,
I was playing in my mother’s pantry, and
in the very wantonness of my sport, I
swallowed a pound of yeast powders, and
ever since, I have been gradually rising,
until I have attained my present size.”
At that moment of intoxicating bliss our
eyes met, and Vestvali murmured that she
was inexpressibly delighted at the oppor-
tunity of meeting us. Whereupon we im-
mediately asked her to do us the honor oi
embracing the opportunity. She stepped
back ten paces, and taking from her pocket
a take line, she advanced upon us, and
draggirg us into the middle of the room,
she mr asnred us from head to foot, ex'
claiming, “foul caitiff, how da rest thou
make such a request in a hotel parlor in
the broad light of a lovely day—dost
thou not fear the prying eyes of passing
chambermaids.”
We replied—“we dost not fear the pry-
ing eyes of all the chambermaids who ev<r
wore short aprons, with little pockets in
“em,” and she immediately said, “oh 1
lilliputian writist, I admire the lingering
grit in thy little back bone,” and she took
us under the arms, and set us up on the
mantlepiece, and embraced us, until we
fairly grunted beneath the pressure of our
pent up feelings, and we exclaimed,
“Vesty, you can do it once more, if it
squashes the last lingering spark of pa'
triotism from out our heart,” and she
stepped back, and tore off her waterfall,
and rushing upon us, she hugged us till
the champagne oozed out of our fingers aild
toes, and then she took us down from the
mantelpiece, and bade us adieu, and gave
us as a souvenier, a rat out of the south
side of her waterfall, and We gave her the
rubber off of our pencil—’twas thus we
met—’twas thus we parted—perhaps to
meet no more.

PASSMAN’S PATENT IE ON TIES
FOR COTTON BALES.
BUCKLE AND BUTTON TIE, United States Patent, April I8(>5.
THE Hoops are cut to lengths of 10,10^ and 11 feet. Ten feet are most generally used, but 1OX
and 11 are sometimes required for large bales. The buckles are fastened to the hoops; the but-
tons will be put up iu small boxes. The weight is about Ten Pounds to the Bale of Cotton.
My Button Tie was the first ofl’ered for sale to any extent in the South, and has been used by
thousands of planters with universal approval. I have made a valuable improvement in the
shape of the button since it was first introduced; and have also procured a patent for a BUCKLE
TIE, which, for simplicity, facility and expedition of adjustment to bales of any or of unequal
size, and for security in holding, is, I think, superior to any offered to the public.
The ad vantages oi Iron over Rope for baling Cotton are now universally acknowledged. It holds
the bale in a much smaller compass; is applied and fastened with as much facility, both in the
country pressing and the recompressing at the sea-ports; lessens immensely the risk from fire;
is strong, and its strength is not impaired by time and exposure as is that of rope. This last ad-
vantage has been strikingly manifested during the war. Thousands of bales of Cotton have been
lost by the rotting or breaking of Rope, which could have been preserved if Iron hoops had been
used. In addition to this, it can be furnished cheaper than rope. The derangement of labor in
the hemp growing States has reduced the supply of hemp to suck an extent as to cause prices to
rule unprecedentedly high; indeed, a sufficiency for baling a moderate cotton crop, cannot be re-
lied on at any price.
I have arranged for the importation of a large quantity of the best English Iron, and have made
arrangements wi, h Messrs. Chambers & Latting for the sale and delivery of my Ties. Parties
ordering, or desiring farther information on the subject, will please address
CXIAITIHLRS & LATTING, No. 61 Carondelet street, New Orleans.
SHIP REFUGE, New Orleans, July 7th, 1859.
II. Fassman, Esq., Orleans Cotton Press: Sir—In January last 1 received from your Press 1809
bales of Cotton, of which about 1000 were compressed and bound with your new "Iron Tie.” I can
safely affirm that the cotton so bound was received in better order than it generally comes from
the Presses; that it stowed better, and enabled the ship to carry more than on any previous voy-
age. The cotton when discharged from the ship in Liverpool, was in better order than the rope
.bound cotton. It is highly preferable for a ground tier, as the damp arising from the ballast has
no effect upon it, for it is well-known by practical men that damps will rot the rope bound. I can
confidently recommend your “Iron Tie,” as I took this lot for an experiment and carefully watched
it both in loading and discharging. Yours respectfully, JOHN HOWARD, Master.
Certificate of Fire Wardens of the Rew Orleans Insurance Companies, and of Alfred Be-
langer, Esq., ex-Chief Engineer Fire Department:
The undersigned. Fire Warden and Fire inspector of the New Orleans Insurance Companies,
are of the opinion that the Iron Tie affords greater protection against loss in case of fire than the
old style of baling with rope. J. YOUENNES, Fire Warden -, JOHN ADAMS, Eire Inspector
I concur in the above.	ALFRED BELANGER, ex-Chlef Engineer Fire Department.
Samples of the Tie can be seen and orders left at the following named houses in Vicksburg :

ANOTHER EIRE!
At half-past 9 o’clock last night, a
fire broke out in Mygatt’s Cotton
Warehouse. The engines were prompt-
ly on the ground, but the smoke for
a time was so dense as to retard all
operations. In a few minutes, how-
ever, the flames broke out in a dense
volume, and raged for some time
with the utmost fury. The exertions
of the firemen were immense, and
they deserve great credit for their ar-
duous efforts to arrest the flames.—
Wygatt’s warehouse, with its contents,
is a total loss. We understand the
property belonged to Dr. Balfour, but
have no information as to the insurance.
The ice-house, owned by Mrs. V. F.
Wilson, a portion of which has been
used by the Odd Fellows as a hall, is
wholly consumed.
As we go to press, there is a flatter-
ing probability that the fire will be
arrested without further damage.

RIVER NEWS.
The river is rising at a remarkably
rapid rate, and the accounts from above
all speak in fearful terms of the im-
mense quantities of water in all the
rivers.
The weather is warm and extremely
pleasant, while business on the levee
wears a most cheerful and business-
like aspect.
Yesterday the Virginia and W. It.
Arthur passed down (from Louisville
to New Orleans,) with heavy freights.
The Olive Branch passed down from
St. Louis to New Orleans, and the
Atlantic from Memphis to New Or-
leans, with 2,600 bales of cotton on
board.
The Mary E. Forsyth and Ruth pass-
ed up from New Orleans to St. Louis.
The fine steamer S. D. Perry, to
White River.
The gay packet Stonewall, is due to-
morrow for Louisville, and all way-
points. We have since learned that
the Stonewall broke her plummer
block, some fifteen miles from here,
and was tow«>-d back to the city.
A late Evansville paper in speaking
of the rise in the waters, says :
The water is now within a foot or
less of high-water mark of 1847. All
the lowlands are deeply overflowed,
and there is great distress, and much
destruction of property will ensue.
On Sunday the News Boy went up to
McLean’s farm, above the city, and re-
moved his stock. We hear of many
corn piles along shore in imminent
danger. All the packets have busied
themselves in saving corn exposed to
the ravages of the water. We antici-
pate a flood equal to that of 1832.
Down in the bayou, there are large
quantities of corn that will unques-
tionably be destroyed if not speedily
removed. Some of the owners, we are
told, yesterday offered the News Boys
one half for removing and saving the
other half; but, for some reason, she
declined the offer. The Charmer has
been engaged in this work, else she
would have arrived ere now. The
water is now over the road below
Pigeon Creek Bridge, and some por-
tions of the streets, we are told, in the
lower part of the city, have been bro-
ken through by the back-water.
The fleet and reliable steamer Rubi-
con ; James Hazlett, Master; Alf.
Grissom, clerk, leaves for St. Louis at
10 a. m. We commend her to ship-
pers and passengers for speed, comfort
and safety.
The fine steamers Leonidas and Kate
Robinson, are both advertised to-day
for Cincinnati. Shippers and travel-
ers will have to draw straws as to
which is the best boat, for both rank
LATER—12 M.
The fire is checked, with no further
damage.
As was the case at the two last disas*
trous fires in this place, attempts were
made to burn other buildings remote from
the scene of destruction.
While the flames were at their height
last night, a cowardly incendiary applied
the torch to this olice, but the flame was
fortunately discovered in time, and extin-
guished. We will present the man who
failed in that villainous attempt, fifty
cents in loyal currency if he will call at
our sanctum within one week from this
date.
No argument could now induce us
to believe, that the late fires in Vicks-
burg originated from any other cause
than that of the incendiaries’ torch.

without mentioning that the popular

day for the dark rolling Yazoo. We
never would have been guilty of much
negligence had it not been for the fact
that everybody "knows any and every-

We would call the attention of our
readers to the card J. C. DuSouchet & Co.
of Evansville, Ind., Commission Merchants
and Wholesale dealers in Produce, etc.,
whom we visited during our late trip to
that city, and would recommend to our
merchants and planters wanting hay, corn,
oats, flour, salt meat, bacon, and especially
corn meal, in which they are large dealers
and have a supply always fresh as they
have in their own employ three mills mak-
ing for them alone. They are represented
to us as being worthy the patronage of
our people and are reliable, and orders en-
trusted to their care will receive prompt
attention, and lowest market rates are al-
ways guaranteed. Evansville enjoys much
better advantages for supplying this coun-
try with supplies than Memphis or Cairo,
as it is from there and that country that
both those places get their supplies, and
it is better always to buy from first hands.

The following report having
nished us too late for Sunday’s
publish it to-day.—Ed.
At a called meeting of the
Association for the purpose of receiving
report of Committee, Mrs. De Moss and
Miss Martin reported, that, through the
kindness of a number of our amateur
musicians and especially of Mrs. Eugene
Roach, they had been able to realize the
sum of four hundred and fifty two dollars
($442,) from the Concert, after paying the
expenses one hundred and fifty dollars for
use of the Theater.
Miss Martin also reported, that, through
the kindness of Dr. Shannon and Mr.
Charles Swett, our Representatives in the
Legislature, a bill granting the Associa-
tion one thousand dollars ($1,000,) for the
purpose of reinterring the Confederate
dead had passed both Houses without a
dissenting voice.
Mrs. Wright reported that up to the
15th of Feb., one thousand and forty:two
bodies had been reinterred, at an expense
of sixteen hundred and seventymine dol-
lars, leaving us without means; and,
but for the timely aid, through the
cert and Legislative action, our
would have been at least suspended.
The following resolutions were unani*
mously adopted:
Resolved, That the thanks ot the Asso-
ciation be tendered Mrs. Eugene Roach,
for the very efficient assistance she has
rendered them by singing in the Concert
for their benefit, which, whilst delighting
the audience by her exquisite music, has
enabled them to realize a handsome sum
in their urgent necessity.
Resolved, That the thanks of the Lai
dies’ Vicksburg Confederate Cemetery As-
sociation be tendered the Legislature for
their donation of a thousand dollars toi |
wards aiding in reinterring "our” dead;]
and that the hearts of the ladies are cheer* \
ed and strengthened in their labor by th. .
sympathy therein expressed.
Resolved, That the thanks of the As*
sociationare due Dr. Shannon and Mr.
Swett, our Representatives in the Legis-
lature, for their cordial and efficient sup-
port of our bill before that body, asking
assistance for our Association.
Resolved, That an urgent appeal be
made to all persons having Confederate
dead buried upon their grounds, or to any
who have knowledge of such graves, to
report them immediately to the Associa-
tion.
Resolved, That the Secretary be re*
quested to furnish a report of this meet-
ing to our city papers.
MISS ELLEN MARTIN,
Secretary.
A meeting of merchants was held last
evening at 7j o’clock, in the Vicksburg
Library Rooms, for the purpose of com*
ing to some definite understanding about
the rates of charges for forwarding, dray
age and storage, and to secure a concert of
action among the merchants generally.—
Owing to the smallness of the meeting no
definite conclusion was arrived at, and it
adjourned to consider the matter more
fully on to-morrow (Wednesday,) evening
at 7 o’clock in the same place, when the
mooted questions will be discussed at
length.
A. full attendance of the merchants and
business men generally is earnestly re*
quested, as a satisfactory adjustment of
these matters is of the utmost importance
to all concerned.
Words of Cheer.—Our friends and
neighbors Messrs. Marshall £ Miller, yes-
terday received a letter from Bordeaux,
France, written by a former citizen of
Vicksburg whose name is familiar to all of
our old citizens. We refer to Harry Ver-
delet, a gentleman whose genial manners
and kindness of heart, as exhibited in by-
gone years, are pleasantly remembered by
very many of our elder citizens. Messrs.
M. & M. are the Attorneys of Mr. Verde-
let, who has yet considerable interest here,
though for some years he has been reside
ing in his native country, la belle France.
In a letter dated Bordeaux, J an. 30th,
1867, Mr. Verdelet says he has seen act
counts of the late dreadful fires in Vicks-
burg, and concludes thus: "If there is
need for aid for the unfortunate sufferers,
please subscribe one hundred dollars for
me. In other times I would have given
five hundred, but now I am poor-” •
Those who knew Henry Verdelet, will
not be surprised at his proffer of aid to
those who need it, and we record with
pleasure this generous and kindly remenu
brance of the citizens of his old home.
Shocking.—We learn that Mr. C.
Orn, having fell down near his barn,
and becoming insensible from cold on
Friday night last, was found the next
morning, by Mr. J. Bizer, nearly de-
voured by hogs. He leaves a large
family.

Theater.—There is a glorious bill up
for to-night, which is the occasion of the
benefit of Miss Isabel Vane, a young lady
who has during many months of arduous
professional labor, earnestly exerted her-
self to please the Theater-going popula-
tion of Vicksburg. She has made many
friends and admirers here, and we think
they will evince their appreciation of her
a good house to-night.
The bill is an unusually attractive one
and consists of the celebrated play of "the
forty theives” and the laughable comedy
"Lady’s Devil.”
Last night "ten nights in a bar-room”
was played to a good house, and the com>
pany covered themselves with new laurels.
This Theatrical week will abound in at-
tractions.
_____________	__________
Concert.—There will be a Concert
at the Presbyterian Church, to-night,
the proceeds of which are to be
devoted to the purchase of a
parsonage for the Minister of that
church. It is needless for us to expa-
tiate upon a matter so apparently
laudable as this. No resident Minis-
ter should remain unsheltered by a
roof, which is one of the appurtenan-
ces of the church to which he belongs,
and in giving a Concert with this ob-
ject in view, the noble ladies of our
community are actuated by the best
and purest motives. The finest ama-
teur talent of the city will be called
into requisition, and Mrs. Iloach
will enchant the audience with
some of the finest selections from her
choral repertoire.

Duel—Both Parties Dead.—In yes J
terday morning’s paper we gove some few
particulars connected with a sanguinary
duel fought the preceding day, in which
one of the contestants was immediately
killed. Since then we have learned a lit*
tie more relative to the affair, and narrate
it as tersely as possible.
The quarrel originated about a lady, and
commencing in a ballroom, found its bloody
termination in the field.
The duel was fought with double-barrel-
ed guns, about a mile above Carrollton,
(not on the other side of the river,) under
the shade of some immense oak trees that
many of our readers will remember.
At the first fire one fell dead, as hereto-
fore stated, and the other was dangerously
wounded. The dead man was carried over
in a skiff to the right bank of the river,
and placed in charge of a relative.
The wounded man has since died from
the effect of his injuries.
The names of the principals in this un-
fortunate affair were Mr. Edmond Lefebre
and Mr. Charles Jenin. We did not in-
tend to publish the names, but found them
so currently spoken, that further conceab
ment is useless.—[N-O. Times, 23d.
The Flood.—The loss of property by
the great overflow at Wilmington, Ill., is
estimated at over $200,000. The freshet
on the Illinois river is greater than has
been known for thirty years. We hear of
bridges being carried away in many places
in this and adjoining States. There js not
a river or a creek in Illinois that is not
"booming,” We learn that the wagon
bridges at La Salle and Peru are gone,
and that nearly every bridge in that region
is more or less damaged. The lowlands
everywhere are covered with water,—[Cairo
