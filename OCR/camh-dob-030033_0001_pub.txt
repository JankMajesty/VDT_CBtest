LETTER OF SENATOR WILSON IN RE KEREN Cg
TO SUFFRAGE IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
Washington, March 22,1867.
J. M. Waskom, Esq.,
My Dear Sir:—In reply to your ques-
tion, “Does the law as it now exists dis-
franchise the rank and file of the soldier’s
who had never taken an oath to support
the Constitution of the United States. . I
have to say that it does not disfranchise
them. The Constitutional Amendment
disqualifies from holding office certain per-
sons who have taken an oath to support
the Constitution of the United States, and
who engaged in the rebellion or gave aid
and comfort it. This class of persons are
disfranchised, and all other persons are
entitled to vote. Those persons are men-
tioned in the constitutional amendment,
so that all persons will know who are dis-
qualified and disfranchised.
Yours truly,
HENRY WILSON.

What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those snooted with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper*
taining to digestion. This class- of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease than those possessed of strong and
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall |
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy ■
and normal condition? We answer; by atten- ■
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented I
and by the use, according to directions, of that'
great strengthening tonic,
