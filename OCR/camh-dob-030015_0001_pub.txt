[Special by Telegraph to the N. O. Times?]
Washington, March 5.—In the Cabim
et sessson to’day the subject of the ap-
pointment of military commandants for
the five, districts in the Southern States,
named in the Military Government act,
was considered. A complete list of; these
assignments was not decided upon, but it ;
is understood that Gen. Schofield will
have command of the first, which includes '
Virginia, and Gen. Hancock t will take
command of the fifth district, which in-
cludes the States of Louisiana and Texas.
The people of Virginia, it is stared, de-
sire the retention of Gen- Schofielddu that
district.
The commandants of the other districts
may be determin don to-morrow, but it is
probable they will not be until the next
meeting of the cabinet.
Col. A. K. Long, of the Pennsylvania
volunteer service, and late of . the Presi<
dent’s household, was confirmed by the
Senate yesterday as captain in the regular
army, and will probably be assigned to
duty fora few months in this city.
There were present at the President's
State dinner, to’night, Gen. Sickles, and
the following Congressmen, via.: G. W.
"Schofield and wife, C. Siltgreaves and wife,
A. J. Rogers, L. Ross and wife, R. P.
Spaulding and wife, J. N. Stillwell and
wife, Meyer; Stfous, Stephen, Tabor Burt,
Vanhorne and wife, H. D. Washburne,
E. W. B. Washburne, M. Walker ana
wife, K. V. Whaley, 8. H. Wilson, Wm.
Wisdom, C. H. Winfield and wife, E. R.
Wright and wife. One more State din-
ner will probably take place, at which the
members elected to the Fortieth Congress
will be the only guests.
Washington, March 5.—It appears
to be settled that the present*^ session
of the fortieth Congress shall not ex-
tend beyond this week, but this is to
be definitely settled in a caucus of
Republican members to-morrow night.
No important legislation is attempt-
ed except the impeachment investiga-
tion, which will undoubtedly be
resumed and referred to the commit-
tee, with power to pursue the exami-
nation of witnesses during the recess,
and report at the next session, which
will likely commence on the 1st Mon-
day in October.
A struggle is in progress*to get the
matter referred to the J udiciary Com-
mittee, in conjunction with an addi-
tional special committee of six mem-
bers.
Gen. Butler disapproves of the line
of investigation pursued and the char-
acter of the testimony sought by Ash-
ley. Gen. Butler thinks it futile to be
fishing for minnows when they should
be trying to catch a whale, and there-
fore he will move an abandonment of
petty charges against Mr. Johnson,
and urge a trial on broader and less
personal grounds, viz: usurpation of
legislative power and disposition of
the railroad interests in the South.
The latter proposition may be. aban-
doned, as it lias been shown that rail-
road property was disposed of under
the direction of Mr. Stanton and Gen.
Thomas.

Washington, March 5. Cameron, in
response to Seward, said, that, had John-
son been a wise man, he would have signed
tho reconstruction bill, and gathered him-
self back into his old harness. He might
then have been forgiven some of the wrong
done during the last four months, but it is
now too late to forgive him.
House. It was officially announced
thot the President had no communication
to make.
In drawing seats Stevens and Wash-
burne were allowed to retain tbeir old
seats.
The caucus nominees were all elected.
Boynton was elected Chaplain. Among
the nominees was Parson Brownlow.
Senate. Several bills were presented,
one to reorganize the Supreme Court.
All were laid on the table until commit’
tees are appointed.
Washington, March 5. Politics are
very calm. The Radicals hold a caucus
to-morrow night when their future course
will be decided on. The chances are in
favor of pushing the impeachment of the .
President. His cavalier treatment of
Congress is commented on. Ho is said to
have signed obnoxious bills for the purpose
of leaving it nothing to do.
The debt statement will appear to-mor-
row. The gold balance is increased. The
reduction of the debt is trifling. Internal
revenue receipts to-day nearly half a mih
lion.
Nashville, March 5. Gov. Brownlow
has issued general order No. 1 for the or-
ganization of volunteer troops to serve
three years, to be paid whenJn actual *ser-v
vide, as provided for the United States
Army, the force to be subject to his orders
Bud those of the Commander in iChief,
and to act as a military police to preserve
the peace and protect the people.
Wilmington, March 5. The North
Carolina Bui eau report for . January, says
there were no outrages and no arrests dur
irig the month.
Alexandria, »March 5. The negro
vote was taken separately. The election
will be contested, provided the white Re-
publican vote? added to the black poll,

She experienced heavy weather and a
number of her crew were washed
overboard and drowned.
Vienna, March 5.—The Eastern
question is becoming more compli-
cated. Dispatches from the South
indicate that there will be general up-
rising of Christians.

What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those anected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
i doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease that, those possessed of strong and
I healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition? We answer, by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
r ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic,

GERMAN BITTERS
Is in every respect
PREPARED BY
OR. C. M. JACKSON,
PHILADELPHIA.
This Bitters is a compound of fluid extracts.
The wots and herbs from which it is made are
gathered in Germany, and their virtues, in the
form of extracts, extracted by one of the most
scientific chemits and pharmaceutists this coun-
try affords. It is
NOT A LIQUOR PREPARATION,
in any sense of the word; contains no whisky,
rum, or any other intoxicating ingredients, and
can be freely used in families without any fear
or risk of those using it contracting the diseasb
or vice of intemperance. We wish this fact
distinctly understood, as many others before
the public are prepared from liquor oi some kind.
During the
CHOLERA SEASON
of 1849, this Bitters were extensively used
throughout the entire country
AS A PREVENTIVE.
and we have not heard of a single instance in
which this Bitters was used, where the persons
suffered from any of the symptoms of Cholera.

I have known Hoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably for a number of years. I have used
them in my own . family, and have been so
pleased witn their effects that I was induced to
recommend them to many others, and know
that they have operated in a strikingly benefi-
cial manner. I take great pleasure in thus pub-
licly proclaiming this fact, and calling the at-
tention of those afflicted with the diseases foi
which they are recommended, to this Bitters,
knowing from experience that my recommend-
ation will be sustained. I do this more cheer-
fully as Hoofland's Bitters is intended to benefit
