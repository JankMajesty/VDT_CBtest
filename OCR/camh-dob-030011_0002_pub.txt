Tux Vicksburg and Jackson publishers
have discontinued the telegraphic reports
of the New. York Associated Press, in com
sequence of their unreliability and meager
ness. We will endeavor to make arranget
ments in a short time, with the Western
Press, which will ensure us full and com-
plete reports. We trust that the Press of
the State will unite with us in this move:

RADICALISM is anexpensive article. It
has already, within the last six years, cost
the country a dissevered Union—a debt of
three millions of dollars—the destruction
of three times that much of the Nation’s
material wealth—the lives of a half million
of men, and a mortgage of grinding and |
paralyzing taxation for generations to come
upon the bone, blood and muscle of the
toiling millions of the land. Unless it be
stayed in its mad career, thisis but a fore-
taste of whatisto come. The country
never was in more imminent peril than at
the present time. Usurpation walks in
the light of day with unblushing front;
and a tyrannical Rump, having folded up
and put away out of sight the Constitution,
seek now to strangle the Supreme Court,
and trample into helplessness the Hxecu-
tive. And yet the people, agonizing’ and |
exuding bloody sweat beneath the killing
burden of taxation that weighs upon them,
still shout hosannas in support of their

oppressors.

Tue Augusta Chronicle is greatly
alarmed at the recent assemblage of
Grant and his Generals in Washing-
ton. “A terrible storm is brewing
at the capital.” Overtures will be
made to these officers by both parties.” |
“This assemblage of brass buttons and
yellow scarfs may get up a carnival of
blood which, in its wild career, may
sweep away the last vestiges of repub-
lican government upon this conti-

nent.” :

A New Terror To tue F, F. V.’s.—
The Richmond Whig is horrified by a bill
recently offered in the Virginia Legisla-
ture, which gives married women rights of
property. This is ‘‘a bill to make enemies
of husbands and wives ;”’ it destroys the
marriage relation as it now exists;”’ “‘it
makes the wife superior instead of subject
to her husband ;’”’ “ther property is her
separate property just asif she were a
single female.”’ ‘This is not matrimony
—it isa thing for which we can find no
suitable name.’’ Thus exclaims and ital
icises the Whig, and then, wiping its drip:
ping brow, goes on to confess: ‘‘We can-
not bring ourselves to consider it gravely,
and yet it relates toagrave subject:’’—
There must have been some marrying for
money down in Old Virginia.

RAREY AND THE JACKASSES.—John
Rarey, the horse-tamer, while he was
in Rome, was terribly annoyed, as
strangers always are, by the indiscrib-
able braying of the jackasses, which
coming to the market early in the
morning with vegetables, always im-
prove the hour when strangers are
enjoying the half-dozing delight which
immediately precedes the pain of
getting up, to bray with especial ve-
hemence, singly and in chorus. No
one who has not suffered it can appre-
ciate the brick-batting, saw-filing
effect of it on the strongest nerves.
Rarey could not stand it, and he swore
he wouldn’t. He watched the awful
little beasts with a professional keen-
ness sharpened by personal pain, to |
see if there was any practicable way
to stop their braying without cutting
their throats, but almost resolved to
do that if there was no other remedy.
He soon noticed that the animal in-
variably straightened its tail out as
stiff as a poker when the erection
commenced, and he darted with the
rapidity of genius to the conclusion
that as the tail and the bray went
together, the bray couldn’t go without
the tail, so he determined to hold the
tail down. He tied a number of the
heavy lava paving stones to stout
strings with slipknots on the ends,
and, while the owners were enjoying
their “cafe latta” at some neighboring
“cafe,” he slipped the nooses over the
unsuspicious tails, and retired to watch
the result. Ina few minutes an espe-
cially noisy jackass was seen to open
his mouth, and gasp convulsively. He
stodd gaping for three or four seconds.
He wheezed, and the lava block swung
sullenly at his heels as he strained to
lift his tail out to the braying level.
Butno soundcame. He looked plain-
tively round at his companions as if-to
ask them what ailed him. His lips
shook, and he dropped the artichoke
leaves he had been munching, as the
idea entered his superstitious fancy
that the devil had somehow got out
of the hogs into him. Another tried,
but an inarticulate grunt was all he
could reach. They all tried a chorus
which had only the same mbrning
rattled and crashed through every
street and lane, but in vain. There
was silence that day in the “Strangers
quarter,” and rejoicing in every

THE U. S. SUPREME COURT.
We commend the following to our read-
ers. It is a voice of good cheer that
reaches us from the borders of the Pacific
bidding us to be true to. ourselves;
It was a happy moment for liberty on

this continent, says the San Francisco Ext
aminer, when the framers of our Govern
ment conceived the necessity of a Supreme.
legal tribunal as a check upon the legisla~
tive branches of the system. The latter
are too often the mere representatives of
some violent public excitement, passion,
or prejudice, which neither cares for, nor
consults about the constitutionality of a
measure, if it gives promise of success for
the time being. It was to avoid to some
extent at least, this infirmity in the law-
making power of a republican system, that
different tenures and different powers were
secured to the two Houses of Congress.—
The period has been reached, however,
when the inferior character of the inem~
bers of both bodies, coupled with an un-
precedented partisan supremacy in’ each,
has over-ridden every barrier to the pas-
sage of improper measures, fixed by the
Constitution. The veto of the Executive
is persistently defied and derided—the pro1
test of the minority ise no longer heard,
much less respected, and the fate of the
Republic, so far as its Jaw-makers are con-
cerned, is little short of a bloody disrup-
tion and overthrow. But, notwithstand—
ing all this exhibition of power and per-
severance on the part of this legion of
madmen, in their assanlts upon the peace
and prosperity of a nation, the Constitus
tion has still left to it a sheet anchor faith
ful to its trust, unmoved by the billows,
unbroken by the gale.

Within the precincts of the Capitol build-
ing, in the same chamber where once as:
sembled the great and good of this land—
where the giants of other days wrestled in
debate and cast a lustre of patriotism, ge-
nius and knowledge over the American
Senate—now sits the Supreme Court of
the United States, the last and solemn
refuge of civil and religious liberty. Upon
this august tribunal all eyes are now turn-
ed, and to its potent voice all men give
heed—because, to zts bidding the citizen
must bow. ‘True, its fiat grates upon the
ear of the Radical and fanatic like the hist
sing of a thunderbolt, for by it his plans
are shivered, his arm is paralyzed; but
the heart of a lover of his country is moy-
ed as if by the thrill of an angel’s trump;
for it seems as if the voice of God mingled
with the sound.

We have long ‘indulged the hope that
there would be found somewhere a break
upon the destructive progress a majority
of the people, in the might of their triv
umph, seem willing to make, if that pro-
gress only tends to harass and extermins
ate those whom they first pillage and then
hate. We at first hoped the ballot box
would perform this allimportant duty, but
it was in vain. When we heard that the
great issues of the day had been transfer-
red from the hustings to the ‘‘consultation
chamber’ of the Supreme Court for final
determination; hope whispered anew its
consolation in this dark hour of an afflict:
ed nation. The chamber has at last dis-
closed its secrets and given to the world its
omnipotent decrees. -

Faithful tribunal! Thy solemn minis-
ters of Justice have heard the fury of the
storm—but sheltered within thy sacred
portals have looked with unruffled gaze
upon the cbart of our liberties, and have
marked out ‘‘the haven where we would
be.”’ Immortal detenders of the Repub-
lic! -Peace hath its victories no less res
nowned than war—for the pen is mightier
than the sword!

Turning aside for 2 moment from the
sublime spectacle of an independent Judi-
ciary, let us inquire briefly into the cause
of this stability in the midst of so much

ness. In the first place, we must concede
to most of the members of the Supreme
Bench of the United States much learn-
ing and integrity; but thisis not all. It
is independent of the persecution which
can be visited upon every other depart-
ment of Government by reduction of sgal-
ary or removal from office. Whilst this
fact reflects great credit upon the foresight
of the framers of the Constitution, it also
secures an expose of the absurdities of the
dominant party when viewed or reviewed
in the quiet retreat of Judicial investiga:
tion. Ex post facto laws have always
been the hated instruments of political
vengeance, Military tribunals—resistless
in their power, and brutal‘in their punish
ment, are considered by the civilian dnd
the common law as the most depraved form
of accusation and trial. It is only toler-
ated whenever other means of vindicating
the right is unavailable in -a free and en-
lightened community, and then it is des
spised because of the fierceness of ‘its im
quisitions. The extent to which these der
cisions go we ate not as yet fully advised.
Sufficient however is known to justify the
belief that no such outrage as is contem-
plated by, Congress when it proposes to
strip a State of its sovereignty, will be
sanctioned by that high tribunal. This
robbery of one member of the sisterhood
by the remainder, may suit those who hope
to profit by the spoils, but certainly it must
be rebuked by the indignant frown of a
just and righteous judge. Then let our
readers repose confidence in the arbiter of
last resort. Letus not forget its oaths, its
independence, and sense of right, but_re-
lying upon these let us look forward to
that final vindication of our principles
which must ultimately confound our foes

and save our country.

Tue Comptroller of the Currency
says that since the decision of the Su-
preme Court of the United States that
the States can tax the shares of nation-
al banks they generally seem disposed
to acquiesce in the decision, and have
paid the tax, although it may not be
levied in strict conformity with the
requirements of acts of Congress.
Two hundred and eighteen banks
have responded to the request for in-
formation on this subject, showing
they have paid $6,412,100 under the
State taxation. Taking the average
rate of taxation and applying it to all
the banks, including those which have
not reported, the approximate total is
$7,849,451. j

Tue Turr.—Among the trotting
matches made for the coming season
on the Long Island turf, are the fol-
lowing:

Hiram Woodruff has matched his
bay gelding, Lew Pettee, against Jas.
D. McMann’s black mare Cora; three
races for $1000 aside; the first at mile
heats, best three in five, in harness;
the second two mile heats and the
third three mile heats. These races
will be trotted early in the spring.

Mr. Hendrickson, of California, has
matched the brown stallion George
M. Patchen, Jr., against the bay stal-
lion Commodore Vanderbilt, for $1000
a side, mile heats, best three in five, in
harness; the trot to come off over the
Fashion Course in May.

The spring season in the South
promises also to be long.

BUCKLE AND BUTTON TIE, United States Patent, April 1865.

rPXHE Hoops are cut to lengths of 10,1074 and 11 feet. Ten feet are most meberally used, but 1013
and Ji are sometimes required for large bales. The buckles are fastened to the hoops; the but-
tons will be put up in small poxes. THE WEIGHT IS ABOUT TEN POUNDS TO THE BALE OF CorTTon.

My Button Tie was the first offered for sale to any exten in the South, and has been used by
thousands of planters with universal approval. I have made a valuable improyement in the
shape of the button since it was first introduced; and have also procured a patent fora BUCKLE
TIE, which, for simplicity, facility and expedition of adjustment to bales of any or of nnequal
size, and for security in holding, is, I think, superior to any offered to the public?

The advantages ot Iron over Rope for baling Cotton are now universally acknowledged. It holds
the bale in a much smaller compass; is applied and fastened with as much facility, both in the
country pressing and the recompressing at the sea-ports; lessens immensely the risk from fire;
is strong, and its strength is not impaired by time and exposure as is that of rope. This last ad-
vantage has been strikingly manifested during the war. Thousands of bales of Cotton have been
lost by the rotting or breaking of Rope, which could have been preserved if Iron hoops had been
used: In addition to eiesned can be ope ued ee er — eg The Nee ack eh orlabor -

SHIP REFUGE, New ORLEANS, July %th/ 199.
H. FASsMAN, Esq., Orleans Cotton Press: Str—In January last J received. from your Press 1809
bales of Cotton, of which about 1000 were compressed and bound with your new ‘Iron Tie.” Lean
safely aflirm that the cotton so bound was received in better order than it generally comes fron.
the Presses; that it stowed better, and enabled the ship te carry more than on any previous yoy-
age. The cotton when discharged from the ship in Liverpool, was in better order than the rope
bound cotton. Itis highly preferable for a ground tier, as the damp arising from the ballast has
no effect upon it, for it is well-known by practical men that damps will rot the rope bound. Ican
confidently recommend your “Iron Tie,” as { took this lot for an experiment and carefully watched
it both in loading and discharging. Yours respectfully, JOHN HOWARD, Master.
Certificate of Fire Wardens of the New Orleans Insurance Companies, and of Alfred Be-
lander, Esq., ea- el Engineer Fire Department : f
The undersigned, Fire Warden and Fire Inspector of the New Orleans Insurance Companies,
are of the opinion that the Iron Tie affords greater Bog against loss in case of fire than the
old style of baling with rope. J. YOUENNHS, Fire Warden; JOHN ADAMS, Fire Inspector
I concur in the above. ALFRED BELAN GER, ex-Chief Engineer Fire Department.
Samples of the Tie can be seen and orders left-at the following named houses in VICKSBURG:

LITERARY THEIVES.

Of all the various species of stealing,
plagiarism is the most contemptible, and
in order to rob it of its ugliest deformities,
various little devices are used by those ex-
perienced in the artef obtaining brains
under false pretences. Many literary
rogues are sufficiently magnanimous as to
-give barefuly sufficient credit to an article
—to leave the reader in doubt, whether or
not it were original, and by the majority
of the world, (who are proverbially casual]
observers, ) they are allowed to complacent»
ly pocket the credit.

Full many a gallant article is cleverly

‘appropriated, by the simple sentence, ‘‘in
the language of an able writer’’ being deftly
woven into the first paragraph, in such a
manner as to leave the impression that the
“language of the “aforesaid ‘“‘able writer’’
only extended to the first tull stop.

"Quotation marks at the top, and none
at the bottom, like charity, often cover 8
multitude of sins—while they leave the
sinner, a sweet little love of a loop hole for
escape, in the event of his being called to

account—yet how few of the “diserimina’ |

ting public’’ would notice the two obseure

little curlicews; and suspect an intention '

to defraud. Pea
Many other similar devices have come
’ under our observation, but we only wish at
present to deal withwhose brazen burglars
of the Press, those dishwater pictorial ex-
crescences on the fair front of literature,
the periodicals of, New York and Boston,
but at. present we would concentrate the
focus of our wrath on that wholsale ‘“‘steal-
ist,’’ the Boston Waverly, which in its
igsue of the 2d inst., publishes without a
semblance of credit, and places a heading
of its own over it, our article describing @

a with an Indian girl, at a masquerade
ahi.

Mr. Dow isthe pilfering, plundering,
purloining, poaching, pirate, whose name
is stuck at the illustrated head, of this re-
ceptacle of confiscated literature.

Mr. Moses Dowis the burglarious, brain-

less scavenger, who fathers this theiving
sheet.

Mr. Moses A. Dow is the man who stole
our “Ingun Gat,’ and we paste the fla-
grant erime,upon his dirty back, aud write
him down, a dastardly footpad on the
highroad of letters—afree-booter, a harpy,

a spoiler, a one-horse land-shark, a literary |

eutspurse, a cabbaging, filching, pens,
maurader, who shoul be incontinently
kicked out of tho back-door of sry ool
dom, and his tracks sprinkled with lime,

——

TE political horizon is o’ercast with
dark and angry clouds, and the radical
party, have at last sueceeded in converting
the Southern States into Territories ; but,
notwithstanding the distracted state of the
country. there yet remains implanted in
every human heart—especially every te-
male human heart, a prediliction for rich
and fashionableattire. In this connection,
we wish to state, that our friends, Messrs
Mzyer & Kaun, are in receipt of a mag-
nificent and varied assortment of Spring
Goods, which excel anything of the kind
ever imported to Vicksburg.

They expect to continue the old practice
of which they have been so long guilty, of
disposing of their goods, on more moderate
terms, than “‘any other man!”’

The gay and festive CRAMER, and the
salubrous and unanimous YERGER, will
always be found at their posts, ready and
anxious to supply the wants of their cus-
tomers. The sumptuous LELAND, and the
exquisite Morir are also on hand. So is

old Frank Ganiiauer. Go and see
them. {

Tye citizens of Vicksburg will be ast
tonished at this wonder, as deseribed by a
Mobile exchange: Read and think if it is
possible such a man could live in this
neighborhood :

“Qne of the largest owners of real es.
tate in Mobile has deducted one-third of
the amount due from his tenants on notes
given the past year.”

THEATER.—Mr. Gustin’s benefit, last
night, was attended by a numerous and ati
tentive audience, who evinced their enjoy- |
ment of the performances hy repeated and
enthusiastic applause,

“Beauty and the Beast’’ and other at-
tractions were put upon the stage, with
the usual taste which has been so eminent-
ly displayed by the present stock company
since their sojourn among us.

For Monday night the celebrated and
beautiful jewess, De Lee, is the grand ats
traction. Her services have been-secured

by the management at an enormous ex!
pense, and we predict that she will create
a sensation which has never been equalled
by the most illustriou: of her predecessors.
” Apart from her high professional repu-

DAY,

RIVER NEWS.

The river rose about two inches yester-
day and the night previous. » This, thoug

small im point of actual altitude, amounts

to a heavy rise when we consider the im-
ynense volumne of water necessary to pro:
duce it.”

Business on the levee was brisk through-

lout the day, though there was but one
| local packet to go out.

The weather was oppressively warm,
with quantities of dust filling the air.

, ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES:
Laurel Hill, New Orleans to Louisville.
— Quitman, New Orleans to Greenville.

Eddie, Vicksburg to Sunflower river.
Hope, for Yazoo City.

The Calumet did not get off, hein an

course of repairs. During the last. few
months Capt: Parisott has been trying to
get a new and better set of wheels for his
boat, and has at last succeeded. The Cal-
umet will leave tormorrow at noon for
Greenwood and the Tallahatchie country,
and will, with her new wheels, make better
time than ever before.

Capt. Metzler, of the Hope, asks us to
request shippers to send down their freight
by four o’clock each evening if possible.

“|The Hope is often detained for hours’ by

small shipments which, while they require
considerable attention, do not pay for the
cost of waiting for them. We hope ship
pers will show all possible consideration in
this matter in future.

The fine passenger steamer H. 8. Turm
er, commanded by Capt. Bob Baldwin,
W. ©. Tompkins, clerk, leaves for, Mem-
phis, Cairo and St. Louis to-morrow, Mon-
day evening at 5 o'clock. The Turner has
been bragging on her speed of late, and to
verify her assertions, brought a heavy load
from St. Louis to New Orleans inside of
five days. For freight or passage apply to
W. M. Williams & Co. agents, or to Gar
ritt & Robbins, passenger agents.

The excellent’steamer T. L. MeGill,-in
cHarge of that courteous gentleman Capt.
Ash C. Hopkins, will be up at 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning for St-Louis, Cairo and
all way landings. ‘The McGill is well fur-
nished for the comfort’ of passengers, and
has large freight accommodations. Her
agents are those cited above.

The large and splendid Columbian, W.
Barnes, Master, G. E. Hawley, clerk, will
leave the Merchants’ & People’s Wharf-
boat at 10 o’clock this (Sunday) morning,
for Memphis, Cairo and St. Louis, touch:
ing at all way landings when desired. Her
officers are clever and courteous gentle
man, and well deserve a fair share of pas-
sengers.

The Emma will leave for Greenville
and “the Bends,” on Tuesday, at 5p. M.
Geo. §. Conery, Esq., will take charge
of the office, Ed Jackson detaching
himself from the boat, to settle up her
unfinished” Yazoo’ River” business.
Andy Young will command as of yore.

A. & M.S8.8. Co., will be up at an

a. m. for St. Louis, Captain H. G.
Carson has charge of the hurricane
deck, and M. T. Cunningham, the
office. J. W. Jennings, agent.

The Olive Branch, of the same line,
will be up to-morrow morning for St.
Louis. Officers J. H.Jones, Master ;
Jno. Hinton, Clerk. Agents, as above.

The fine Baltic, Captain Pat Yore,
will be down this morning for Nat-
chez, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans.
For freight or passage, apply on the

The fine packet Virginia, will be up
this morning, for St. Louis, under
command of .Capt.. Wm. Fitzgerald,
with Alf Armstrong in the office. For
freight, apply to J. W. J ennings. For
passage, to Kirnan & Forbes, on the
Lower Wharf boat.

Accounts from the North represent
most of the upper rivers to be declin-
ing. The Wabash, and other rivers in
the interior of Illinois and Indiana,
are the only ones that are still ‘on the
rampage.” *

From present indications, we think
the lower Mississippi will soon come
to a stand, and soon commence reced-

ing, giving the planters some chance
to make a crop.

Dr. H. SHANNON has returned to the

city, and can be found at his office, “over
Ellis & Warner's old stand.
