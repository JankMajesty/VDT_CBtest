VICKSBURG DAILY TIMES
ATURDAY MORNING, March 30, 1867.
OJTICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY.
Official Paper of Washington county.
T. B. MANLOVE, HARRY MOSS,
Editors.
We exceedingly regret to learn from the
Natchez Democrat of the 26th, that its
very able and talented editor Col. Holt, is
about to break up his connection with the
paper. The Colonel is a graphic and
spirited writer, and tis with sincere sor-
row we see him leave the corps editorial.
Success attend him.
“Times change, and men change with
them,’’ is an aphorism not less trite than
true. The Vicksburg Herald, of January
5th, 1867, contained the fo lowing edito-
rial paragraph, which we reproduce as a
striking commentary on the present course
of that journal. We are indebted to the
Brandon Republican for unearthing this
political gem :
The people of the South spurn the con-
stitutional amendment, because we are re-
quired by our votes to say that those gal-
lant generals, those brave soldiers, whose
courage and fortitude have shed a lustre
upon us as a people, unrivalled in history,
shall hold no office of profit or trust either
State or Federal- Such action on our part
would be more cowardly and criminal, than
deserting one’s colors in time of battle.
The "Southerner who votes for any such
terms with the Radicals, should be pil-
loried in shame and disgrace as a rene-
gade.
But, even were we so far lost to all sense
of honor as to disfranchise our glorious
Confederates, we have not the slightest
idea even then that the Radicals would
admit the South prior to the next Presi-
dential election. They have broken faith •
with us, and we have no confidence in
their promises or pledges. The adoption
of the amendment would not only indeli-
bly disgrace us as a people, but would
break up the Conservative party at the
North, and put us more completely in the
power of the Radical faction than we now
are.
BAKER’S CREEK.
Col. Moss :—During the late so-called
fratricidal, international, internecine and
somewhat complicated war, I was decidedly
a peace man—my motto being “millions
for defense, not one cent for tribute; ’' but
since the “bottom of the thing dropped
out,” I have become a BeZZ igerent, and
in order to ventilate my warlike feelings, I
made a flying trip nigh to the scene of the
Champion Hill fight. All around about
with beauty teeming, from the pine-clad
hills of the State of Copiah, meandering
through the classic vales of Hinds, paus-
ing where the water is low, not far from
Clinton and Raymond, and dashing past
Rollon's with tortuous windings, and
swinging by a flank movement, in an in-
congruous and somewhat versatile manner
as it were, close to Edwards’, the above
euphonious, lovely stream, winds its way
for about fifty miles, gladdening and fertiliz-
ing, and occasionally overflowing many
broad and rich acres, until at last lingers
ing, as if unwilling to leave the homes of
the happy dwellers on its banks or there-
abouts, it sullenly mingles its waters with
those of the dark and turbid Northern
“Black,” but Southern Big Black River.
This is no fancy sketch Mr. Moss, it is all
as true as preaching, and will be endorsed
by anybody in Hinds. This purling stream,
now smoothly winding its way along its
Moss covered banks, or anon dashing with
heedless velocity over its pebbled bottom,
(there is no danger of it drooping out,)
here reflecting the dwelling of some
whilome wealthy planter, and here the
primeval cairn, (surely you will be alle to
understand my meaning,) and way over
yonder the squirrel gracefully, climbing his
sweet gum or simmon tree, and not fur off
the ottei1—notold Abe—as a dernier resort,
damming its waters, or doing his dambdest
to do so, offers to the enterprising manu-
facturer of wooden nutmegs, the swigging
lager-beer drinking German, the versatile
Frenchman, or the ever penetrating, never
to be forgetten and eternal and everlasting
indomitable Jew, inducements for settle-
ments such as are rarely presented to the
longing eye of frail mortality- I have not
time just now to enter into details, but
at some leisure moment, with your per-
mission, hereafter, I will furnish facts and
figures, showing that the latter clause of
this communication caq be fully subs tain
tinted.
SALAMAGUNDI.
The New Orleans Times, of day before
yesterday, speaks thusly of Mayor Mom-
roe, who was deposed by Gen. Sheridan
on the 27th;
Dropping in at the Mayor’s office about
3 o’clock' yesterday afternoon, we found
the late Mayor, lion. JohnT. Monroe, the
sole occupant, if wt except his assistant
secretary, Mr. Marks. Mr Monroe was
quietly smoking his yipe, and did not seem
at all surprised, nor much put out of tem-
per by being summarily put out of office.
He remarked that this was the fifth
(and undoubtedly the last) time that he
had been deposed from the Mayoralty of
New Orleans. First, Gen. Butler notified
him verbally that he was “no longer Mayor
of the city,' ’ but subsequently sent an or-
der reinstating him until he could
find a suitable substitute. This substi-
tute being found, Mr. Monroe was again
removed; this time from the City Hall to
Fort Pickens. Three years elapsed, and
he returned, and was again o' % ’ " ;
of New Orleans, but within one hour after
installation in the chair as Chief Municipal
Magistrate his functions were suspended
by Gen. Canby. A few week later, and
he once more assumed command in the
City Hall, but the riots occurring, caused
Gen. Baird to supercede him by a military
officer. He was, however, soon again, and
lor the fifth time, reinstated as Mayor, ana i
now for the fifth time he has been ex- |
polled.
The last official document Mr. Monroe
received was the report of Surveyor Pilie
on the levees, which will be found vise
where; the last order he issued was to the
darkey porters, when the hour for adjourn;
ment came : .“Close up and sweep out."
Exeunt omnes.	. ;
Mayor Heath did not call around at his ;
new office yesterday, but is expected to do |
so this morning. Mr. -Monroe says he willI

VICKSBURG TIMES, SATURDAY, MARCH 30, 1867.
We are alone in our glory,and must,
i prepare some copy. Scissors are an
! implement we despise, and if possi-
i ble we never allow them to touch our
unsullied hand, upon whose fore-finger
and thumb rests in gloomy solitude
the sacred dust of a thousand lead
pencils. “Back thoughts’" deep down
into our soul”—the foreman calls for
“copy,” and by the printer's ink which
will bedew the faces of his posterity,
lie shall have no clippings save the
variegated pin-feathers clipped from
the wings of our unlimited fancy.
Let us slash into the weather, and ■
give river reporters enough informa- i
tion on that hard-ridden subject to Inst
them n twelve month.
A t this present writing the weather
is dark, doleful, desponding, desolate,
disconsolate,, drooping, downcast, de-
pressing, discouraging, dispiriting,
disheartening, dull, demure, dirty, di-
luted, damp, disgusting, dolorous, dis-
pleasing, distasteful, distressful, disas-
trous, deplorable, dreadful, dreary,
deluge-egating—unpleasant, unaccep-
tible, uncomfortable, unwelcome, un-
satisfactory, unpalatable, undesirable,
unlucky, untoward, unaccomodating,
unendurable, unpopular, uncommon,
shocking, gloomy, melancholy, cheer-
less, sombre, lugubruous, bilious, fu-
nereal, muddy, misty, miry, moist,
aqueous, aquatic, humid, swampy,
juicy, lonely and lonesome.
Having proven, beyond the possi-
bility of a doubt that the weather, to
say the least of it, is not serene, let us
turn to the political horizon.
The political horizon is dark and
lowering, (as Mr. Hillyer and Mr. Yer-
ger and all the big editors say.) Of
course we are excusable for repeating
—“the political horizon is dark and
lowering." Well suppose it is “dark
and lowering;” the more printer’s ink
there is squirted at it, the more dark i
and lowering it will become. The j
i Radicals are a “loathsome, noxious
mass of corruption,” as Mr. Frantz !
and Mr. Albert Pike say, but wc have I
no doubt if Mr. Frantz and Mr. Pike
would quit stirring the “loathsome
noxious mass,” with their long edito-
rial ladles, the scent might die out. Its
a bad plan to talk too much politics in j
these piping times of peace. Look at I
Senator Alcorn—he rolled up, his
breeches and waded out into the sea of
politics, and along came Friar Law-
rence and gobbled him up like a sun
pierch grabbing a red worm, and
chawed him so awfully that his hide
would’nt hold politics anymore than
a ladder would hold saw-dust.
Look at us—we talk not often of
politics—neither do we frequently
write big leaders—yet Frantz, in all
his glory, is not arrayed in dead-head
clothes any finer than ours.
“The vandal hordes desecrated our
firesides,” “the ruthless invader pol-
luted," with his foul heel, our sacred
soil,” but the candidates who kept out
of the war by going to Congress, told
us all that, and now its dead matter.—
When we send for a doctor we don’t
want him to harangue us with a dif-
fusive looseness about his dead kin-
folks, but we want him to dish out his
recuperating material so that we can
start fresh with the world. That’s the
way with the South—she’s sick, and if
the press pretends to be a social and
moral doctor, it should not roll up its
sleeves and scratch away among the
melancholy ashes of the past, and rake
out the bleaching bones of blasted
hopes forever lost, but rather bind up
with sound suggestions and staunch I
with good advice, the wounds which |
yet bleed in memory’s veins.
We would not fill up, forever, the j
fountain of sweet reminiscence, but i
let its rushing waters flow on at times,
bearing us back upon their bosom
through the long, long lapse of wasted
years, so mournfully fringed with the
bleaching bones of brave men and,
true, who poured forth their willing
blood, a crimson oblation to the God I
of battles. But we live in a most as-1
tonishingly practical present, and if we |
allow ourselves to float listlessly along j
the tide of time regardless of rushing
events, we will inevitably stand upon ;
its banks.
Steamboats and railroads, and saw
mills and brick houses, and levees, and
corn and cotton and greenbacks, are
not occult questions—hidden beneath
the accumulated rubbish of speculative
discussion. They are what we call
“live matter” — they are palpable,
prominent facts, admitting of broad,
sound, sensible ideas, which can be !1
clothed in hard, sound, Saxon words. !
Let us then put our shoulders to the j
wheel, and altogether, with a strong !
hearty tug, and a heave ho, push into !'
public notice, every plan, scheme, de- j I
sign, project, proposal or proposition,
which can practically forward the in- ;
terests of the South; and snap our fin. j1
gers at all. the isms which spring like j (
mushrooms in the rank fields of fanat- 11

press, beneath the foundation of a yet <
glorious South, and raise her, if possi- 1
ble, to her former level by the strong j
physical suasion of energy and mus-
cle. Let us not waste our time in j1
criticising the manner in which our \ (
enemies cultivate their butter beans, j <
while our butter beans are perishing ; 1
from neglect. But when their actions !(
do infringe upon our rights under the \ j
Constitution, let us, in straight-for-;;
ward, honest, manly, out-spoken ;

[Special to the New Orleans Times,
Washington, March 27.—A special
clause, making provision for the support
of radical newspapers in Louisiana was i
tacked on to the general appropriation bill.
This would of course fully warrant a veto
of the whole bill, but it is presumed to be j
hardly probable that the President will |
feel himself called on to decline to approve
the bill, however shameless may be the
violation of constitutional principle and
parliamentary law involved in this action.
Yet it is not impossible that he may feel
himself called on to veto the bill and throw
<fhe responsibility for the consequences
ere it really belongs.
I After a sharp debate between Butler and
Schofield, to-day, the bill in relation to the
appropriating of the moneys taken from
the Citizens’ Bank of Louisiana, was laid
on the table, and so effectually killed. The
j effect of this, apparently, will be to leave
I the claim of the Citizens’ Bank to the
| money open without conditions.
The Senate has as yet taken no action on
the amendment of the House to its reso-
i lution for adjournment, and the probability
: is that a conference will be held to morrow
\ for the purpose of settling the question.
I It is rumored and believed to be pretty
well established that the congressional
committee has advised the radicals of Con-
necticut to register the negroes of the
State as voters, and has promised to sus-
tain them in the action ir they do. Very
serious consequences may be apprehended
from this course if it be pursued, as is
presumed " to be the purpose, in all the
States.
I Gen. Slocum has been nominated for
the post of naval officer at the port of
New York, and it is supposed that his
| confirmation is pretty certain.
Mr. Kennedy, superintendent of the
| census bureau, has been nominated for the
! post of Commissioner of Agriculture, in
the place of Newton, who has resigned.
The bill introduced by Senator Render1
son making appropriations _ for the repair
of the levees on the Mississippi river was
i to-day recommitted.
Messrs Cresswell and Bond are here en -
' deavoring to organize an opposition to the
Maryland Convention.
The Judiciary Committee reported ad-
versely on the nomination of Gen. F. P.
Blair for the Austrian mission, and the
' probability therefore is that he will not be
confirmed. Ex-Gov. Cox of Maryland is
a prominent candidate for the appoint
: ment.	ELA.

Cotton is about all at hand, or will be in

Western products are expected in large
quantities. There will be no deficiency in
cereals this season. The Northern papers
under the effects of a few days of spring,
remark the prospects are good for one of
the largest yields of wheat for ten years
past. There is not the remotest proba-
bility of a scarcity of breadstuff's and pro-
visions.
The transactions in gold were light to-
day. Sales of $5000 at 134J and $1500 at
134K; $20,000 on private terms.
Cotton.—Wc have a dull market to
note, though sales of to-day foot up about
the same as yesterday—in round numbers
2500 bales. Few factors uncovered their
stocks, and most all were firm in their
holding rates; yet those who sold, had to
do so at a slight decline, £ to £e. The
market is not quotably lower, however, as
with the present and prospective light re-
ceipts, factors prefer to rest tranquil, and
hold at the following quotations, viz : Or-
dinary 26i@27c.; good ordinary 27 J@28b.;
low middling, 29@29Jc., and middling, 30

THE IRISH WAR.
County Dubliu. -- The First Blood.- Th
Fight at Tallaght.
On last night armed bands of Fenians
assembled in various places in the suburbs
of Dublin, and attacked the police stations
Kilmacud, Tallaght and Glencullen. The
chief attack was made at Glencullen bv a
body of about five hundred men, who as-
sembled on Tuesday night at Milltown,
and proceeded to the Dundrum Station,
on which they made an unsuccessful at-
tack. They next attacked the barrack at
Stepaside, and captured the constable and
four men. The Glencullen police barrack
was the first point of attack. Here the
police made a spirited resistance. Several
volleys were exchanged, and the police had
finally to surrender. The Fenians then
proceeded through the mountains to Killai
kee, having made in all thirteen prisoners.
At Tallaght the Fenians numbered from
five hundred to six hundred. Several
collisions occurred between them and the
police during the night. In the first the
police force consisted of twelve men under
Superintendent Burke, on the first fire the '
Fenians ran. The second skirmish took
place between the same party of police and
another body of Fenians; volleys were
exchanged, one of the Fenians was mor-
tally wounded, and another wounded se-
verely. The Fenians, who, though in
large force, were imperfectly armed, de-
i camped, hastily throwing away their
weapons. A detachment of lancers was
sent to Tallaght this morning and captured
• eighty-three of the inrurgents. The at-
tack made by the Fenians on the Kilma1'
cud Station failed, and the party made off
in a panic to the Dublin mountains. • The
Fenians were seen in large numbers dur-
ing the night at Kilmainham, Crumlin,
and in the direction of the Green Hills.
The roads at Crumlin were patrolled dur-
ing the morning by pickets of the fifty-
second regiment, and fifty-two persons I
were arrested.
Arms of all kinds and ammunition have
been found in large quantities'on the sev- j
eral roads where the Fenians had been.
A body of Fenians, one thousand strong, '
mustered on Tuesday night in the potato ;
market, and came into collision with a
Party of thirty police. Volleys were ex-.
changed, and several Fenians were wound- j
ed and twenty-five captured. One hun-
dred and twenty .three prisoners have been .
captured altogether, and have been coms
mitted.

On Tuesday night a wide-spread and
formidable insurrection was begun by the
Fenians, in the South of Ireland. The
rising was made simultaneously in parts of j
the counties of Cork, Limerick, Tipperary |
and Clare. Owipg to general interruption
of the telegraphic, and railway communi-

Haight & Chambers “Sirkis.”—The
talented artists of this wonderful combina1
tiou gave two of their unique performan-
ces?, on yesterday, to the entire satisfaction
of the multitudinous assembly that had
gathered in their fashionable resort of
amusement. We have not time nor space
io specify the wonders we witnessed, while
quietly seated upon the nicely carpeted
seats; but, we can say, that we were never
more agreeably entertained in our lives.—
Old Sam Lathrop and Gus Shaw dispensed
io us from their larder of original wittis
cisms, until our sides fairly ached from the
exertion of prolonged laughter. Our
“devil” was there, and he laughed. In
fact, it is beyond the province of man to
restrain his risibilities while listening to
these “sawdust commediens.” The per-
formance is good and respectable, and we
were ipleased to see so many of the elite
of our city in attendance.
They give two more of their performan-
ces to* day, which closes their engagement
in this city. Let none of our amusement
loving populi fail to visit them.

A GENTLEMEN from Goodwin, Mis-
sissippi, presented a draft, Wednes-
day, at the First National Bank, in
Cairo, calling for $1,270, payable to
order of J. L. Baker, which the cash-
dr immediately recognized as a for-
gery. The gentleman stated that he had j
received the. draft in payment for
mules, from a man in Goodwin, who
had at the time, a large amount of the
frame kind of paper on Land.
| Iii the twenty lour hours ending at 6
o’clock yesterday evening, the river had
risen 3f inches, which is such an encourage
ing fall off from our reports of the last two
days, that we begin to entertain hopes of
the subsiding of the waters.
The weather is somewhat lowering, and
; the clouds betoken more rain.
Business on the levee yesterday evening
; was extremely active, and there were such
> a quantity of drays that we found it al-
’ most impossible to tread our way through
them.
The red heifer still depredates on Mr
Williams’ corn.
We have information from St. Louis oi
27th, which states that the river at thal
! date was again rising there. On the same
! day it was stationery at Louisville and
! falling at Cincinnati.
Great suffering and destitution are said
to exist among the overflowed inhabitants
between this and Memphis, where a meat*
ing was held the other day to arrange
some means of relief. It was attended by
several prominent steamboat captains,
who generously proffered the use of their
boats in distributing provisions and other
necessaries. In this matter Vicksburg
I should also take a hand.
We hear of no fresh crevasset, but learn
I from the New Orleans papers that sev-
eral points between that city and Baton
Rouge are threatened. It is strange that
the New Orleans river reporters give no
statements of the amount of daily rise
down there.
The crevasse in the Grand Levee at
Morganza, has flooded the richest sections
of Point Coupee parish, and the devasta-
tion of the country is said to be greater
than ever before known. This levee was
one of the largest in the world, and was
only recently completed at an immense
outlay, but the angry waters now sweep
through it bearing destruction and ruin to
the thousands of fair acres in its rear.
The river reporter of the Jackson Mis*
sissippian. says with an obfustication of
ideas almost as ridiculous as those which
sometimes beset the river man of the
Herald:
We learn from a gentleman who arriv-
ed here last night from Vicksburg, that a
negro settlement opposite that city, known
as DeSqto, had been overflowed. Every
effort was made by citizens of Vicksburg,
to reach the unfortunate inhabitants, but
despite every assistance rendered, some
eighty are known to have perished in the
waters. The houses and shanties have
been swept away, and the entire popula-
tion of the settlement left homeless and
destitute.
“The gentleman who arrived last night
from Vicksburg” and gave that informa-
tion, must have been out all night in the
rain.
ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES:
Swallow, N. O. to Cincinnati.
Kate Kinney, St. Louis to N. O.
R. E. Lee, Memphis to N. O.
Gen. Quitman, N. O. to Memphis.
Indiana, N. O. to Louisville.
The Calumet was expected last night.
The Cornelia will be up to-night.
The Dan Able and St. Patrick have
temporarily laid up on account of high
water, but w ill resume on the 2d of
April.
We had the pleasure of meeting on
the Lee yesterday evening, Mr. E. II.
Lewis, correspondent of the Memphis
Avalanche.
The gay old Hope, in command of
Capt. Tom Metzler, leaves for Yazoo
City this evening at 6 o’clock.
The line propeller E. J. Good, is re-
ceiving freight at II. M. Floyd & Co.’s
warehouse, for Big Black river, which
stream she will ascend as high up as
Vernon.
The "Great Republic,” about which
we have heard and read so much, will
arrive to-day or to-morrow, and our
citizens will have an opportunity to
inspect this pride of the waters. She
leaves for New Orleans, Sunday eve-
ning at 5 o'clock, affording a rare
chance for passengers. T. R. Kirnan
& J. S. Robbins, are her passenger
agents.
THE WHOLE LOWER COAST TO BE OVER-
FLOWED.
Unless immediate and ample labor
and materials are brought io bear upon
the levees of the right bank, both of
Jefferson and Orleans, not Algiers and
Jefferson only, but the entire coast,
dow n to Fort Jackson, will be under
water in a few days, and the parish of
St. Charles will share the same fate,
though its own levees be repaired.
The new levee in front of McDon-
ogh has again cracked and given way,
in different places, above and below
where the sink occurred Sunday last;
and Tuesday night, at ten and eleven,
the alarm bells were rung, lest some of
the sleeping inhabitants near the
threatened disaster might be drowned
by some sudden breaking through of
the current, and the almost instantane-
ous submerging of their houses.
These people, renters for the most
part from city landlords, will move
away; but the rents and foundations
of the tenements will be lost to their
owners, while the superstructures, if
not also washed away, will be rotted
and renddered in a manner valueless.
The people of Algiers, for the most
part, are at work in their shipyards,
indifferent to the danger which may in
a few hours put an end to their labors
for months and ruin all the appliances
they have erected fortheir industries.
The planters below, with their hun-
dreds of hands in their cornfields, are
busy fixing up for a crop which this'
flood will in a few hours utterly de-
stroy.
In the meantime, the engineer, Mr.
Lewis, with a few hands, picked up here
and there, needing supervision at different
points* but without it, lacking carts, for
cartmen refuse to work on credit, lacking
material because it cannot be hauled, and
lacking men, has been on the ground day
and night since Sunday vson, and is worn
i out with unequal labors.
i The exigency requires united effort. The
• city, whose peopjA are heavy owners of
.' A Igiers property, whose business will be
| so much diminished by so vast a destruct
tion of plantation property, the Opeknu
«as Railroad ^.ompLvy, whose uiachinG
bhops and car factories will be submerge
cd and their track rendered useless for a
long period, the ship builders, carpenters
and other inhabitants of Algiers, who will
suffer like disaster, and the planters be-
low, whose entire year will be one of loss
if this levee be not secured, should come
at once to the rescue.
We would state that the old levee still
stands at McDonoghvllle, with som^ low
places along it, over which the river dash-
es with the wind. Yesterday the strong
south .west wind brought the river up some
seven inches; te’dayitis lower again.—
The crown of the levee has been more
broken since we saw it yesterday than be-
fore, and the line of break in the rear of
the new levee greatly extended.
If bulkheads are placed all along the
base of it in the rear, as has been done at
the place which gave way Sunday, and a
sufficiency of dirt filled in promptly, the
whole line can be made sate, but neglect
by the people most interested will prevent
this from being effected, and they must go
under. It might serve them right that
this might be so; but many who cannot
help themselves would suffer.
HAIGHT & CHAMBERS
COLOSSAL CIRCUS
Headquarters Sawboneism, >
Vicksburg, March 27th, ’67. )
At a regular meeting of the Sawbones’
Club, held at a time “whereof the memory
of man runneth not to the contrary,” many
members were present, and their lowering
looks, and scowling faces betokened “dan-
ger ahead,” and as a long-legged, lank-
jawed, wolfish looking member rose in
his place, the following beligerent, lugu-
brious, diaphragmatical, abdominalibus
preamable and resolution was offered, and
after elaborate dissection, disarticulation,
ampution and manifestation, was adopted :
Wheras, “Ph nt stir,” has snapped
his quill at Sawbones, and insinuated that
whips don’t cost anything, and that
gloves are made to shake hands with “Lo»
cals” in, and insinuates that Sawbones
are expected to make work for,'the Sexton,
and fill up “loose places” in the local col-
umn with obituary notices. Therefore, be
it—
Resolved, That on the first opportunity
we will scalpel “Ph nt spr” from the oc-
cipito frontalis, to the langur colli; and
that if ever he raises his lerator labie sw
pirioris alacque nasi in the direction of
Drug Stores, or .Sawbones, that we will
make a compound, complex, comminuted
fracture of his backbone, from the cerrical
vertebra to the os coeeyx.
Whereupon the Club adjourned.
