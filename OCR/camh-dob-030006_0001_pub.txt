VICKSBURG DAILY TIMES-
TUESDAY MORNING, Feb. 26, 1867.
The States of the South Under the
Military Bill.
Yesterday morning, says the New Ori
leans Times, of Sunday, we gave the bill
which has passed the Senate for the gov
ernment of the States declared the rebel
States. Under this bill the States referred
to are divided into five military Districts,
to each of which an officer, not below the
rank of Brigadier General is to be assigned.
His powers appear to be limited to the
protection of personal rights, and the pun’
ishment of crimes and offences. He is
given the discretion of determining how
all crimes and offences may be punished,
whether by the local civil tribunals or by
military commissions, the only limitation
being that no cruel or unusual puuishi
meats shall be inflicted, and no sentence
of death executed without the approval
of the President. The laws and regula-
tions of the army are to be continued in
operation, except in so far as they conflict
with the provisions of this act. It is not
made very clear in what particulars they
do so conflict, and it is consequently left
very doubtful whether the military com-
manders may in the exercise of their penal
jurisdiction apply to citizens the provisions
of the military code or regulations of the
service. Indeed no system of civil or
municipal law, so far as crimes and offen-
ces are concerned, is recognized, and the
fair interpretation of this act seems to be
that the people of the States, placed under
this military government, shall be subjec-
ted to just such laws as govern and apply
to soldiers in service.
It is true that under section six there
appears to be a recognition of such civil
governments as may exist in these States,
but they are expressly declared to be pro'
visional, and subject to the paramount au-
thority of the United States at any time to
abolish, modify, continue or supercede the
same.
It is not clear as to what is meant by the
words “authority of the United States.”
Who constitute that authority ? Is it the
President, or the President and Congress,
or the latter ? or do the military represent
that authority ? They certainly do by the
previous provisions, so far as all crimes
and offences are concerned ; but how in
regard to civil rights ? Have they any
authority over the civil tribunals and the
ordinary civil jurisdiction and legislation?
This section sixth contemplates elections
to be held for officers under the Proviso
ional Government, but leaves undeter-
mined the powers and duties of such civil
officials when elected. To what law and
constitution are . they to look for these
duties and powers ?
Section fiv.e sets forth fully and dis-
tinctly enough the qualifications for voting
and holding office; and as to the disquali-
fications, embodies the following, being
section three of the proposed constitution-
al amendment:
“Sec. 3. No person shall be a Senator
or Representative in Congress, or elector
of President and Vice-President, or hold
any office, civil or military, under the
United States, or under any State, who,
having previously taken an oath as a mem’
ber of Congress, or as an officer of the
United States, or as a member of any State
Legislature, or as an executive or judicial
officer of any State, to support theConstii
tution of the United States, shall have em
gaged in insurrection or rebellion against
the same, or given aid or comfort to the
enemies thereof. But Congress may, by
a vote of two-thirds of each House, re-
move such disability. ”
Disfranchisement depends on'two disi
tinct facts.
1.	You must have held some office under
the United States Government or that of
any of the States in which you took an
oath to support the Constitution.
2.	You must have engaged in insurrect-
ion or rebellion against the United States,
or given aid or comfort to the enemies
thereof. Both facts must exist to produce
disfranchisement. Gen. Forrest, who
never held a State or Federal office in
which he had sworn to support the Con’
stitution of the United States, would not
be disfranchised on account of his partici-
pation in the rebellion. The persons iw
eluded in this class of disqualifications can
peither hold office or vote in the organiza-
tion of the State, nor ever afterwards,
unless their disability is removed by a vote
of two-thirds of each House.
A difficult question will arise under this
section as to the meaning and intent of the
words “giving aid or comfort to the ene-
mies thereof. ” These words have been
limited by judicial intrepretation to “ma-
terial aid and comfort to carry on the war,”
and never been made to apply to mere in-
cidental or sentimental aid, to the aid of
opinion and sympathy, or even to contru
butions given to individuals engaged or
about to engage in the war.
This, however, is only one of many other
questions which will arise from this ex-
traordinary bill upon which the courts
will have to pass.
The New Orleans Times of the 23d,
contains a special dispatch from Selma,
Ala., stating that the two hotels at Union-
town in that State, the female academy,
four or five residences and several stores
were burnt on Thursday last. The loss is
estimated at $120,000, upon which there
is an insurance of $1000. It is supposed
to be the work of the same incendiary that
set fire to Vicksburg.

WASHINGTON.
Washington, Feb. 25.—The Presi-
dent is urged with warnings by the
Herald and Post, to veto the abomin-
able tariff bill. By the Tribune: Veto

pound interest notes. By the World:
The veto is an outrageous reconstruc-
tion bill.

He predicts six weeks’ session.
The Revenue fraud Committee

of the- manufacturers so tainted,
confidence in local officers is so shaken,
that a reorganization is necessary.

An INTERESTING QUESTION.
What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those anected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract thi
disease than those possessed of strong and
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition? We answer, by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat-
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic,
HOOFLAND’S
GERMAN BITTERS,
PREPARED BY
Dr. C. M. JACKSON,
PHILADELPHIA.
This Bitters is a compound of fluid extracts.
The roots and herbs from which it is made are
gathered in Germany, and their virtues, in the
form of extracts, extracted by one of the most
scientific chemits and pharmaceutists this coun-
try affords. It is
NOT A LIQUOR PREPARATION,
in any sense of the word; contains no whisky,
rum, or any other intoxicating ingredients, ana
can be freely used in families without any fear
or risk of those using it contracting the disease
or vice of intemperance. We wish this fact
distinctly understood, as many others before
the public are prepared from liquor of some kind.
During the
CHOLERA SEASON
of 1849. this Bitters were extensively used
throughout the entire country
AS A PREVENTIVE,
and we have not heard of a single instance in
which this Bitters was used, where the persons
suffered from any of the symptoms of Cholera.

Dear Sir—I take great pleasure in testifying
to the extraordinary remedial qualities of the
Hoplland’s German Bitters, procured at your
establishment.
A member of the family has been for many
years a perfect Martyr to Dyspepsia, Palpita-
tion of the Heart, and other distressing off-
spings ol a torpid liver, until persuaded to try
the above celebrated remedy, which in a few
weeks resulted in making her (to use her own
words) “a new woman.”
You are at liberty to make any use of this you
see fit, or refer similar sufferers to
Yours, truly, A. MoMAKIN.

tist Church, Pemberton, N. J., formerly of the
