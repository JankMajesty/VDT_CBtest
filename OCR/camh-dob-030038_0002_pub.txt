OFFICIAL TAPER OF THE CITY,
Official Paper of Washington county.
T. B. MANLOVE, * HARRY MOSS,
Editors.
We learn that the Lindell House, in St.
Louis, said to be the largest hotel in the.
world, was completely destroyed some
day’s ago by fire. It was erected at a cost
of nearly a million dollars, and was only
partially insured.
The introduction of the Prussian mili-
tary system in Northern Germany, and the
prospect of further wars, are driving great
numbers of valuable emigrants to our
shores. Since the 1st of January, 6,719
Germans have landed in New York alone.
The Nashville Union and Dispatch says
that the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad,
from Lynchburg, Virginia, to Bristol, is
again in running order, and trains are ma-
king regular trips. The only break be-
tween Bristol and Chattanooga is the
bridge at Strawberry Plains, which will be
repaired in a few days.
Health of Bishop Green.—A para*
graph was published last week stating that
this venerable and beloved prelate was very
ill, and not expected to live ; but a tele-
gram from Cowan, Tenn., enclosed to us
by his son from Chatawa, Miss., brings
the gratifying intelligence that the Bishop
is well, though slightly indisposed about a
week ago.—{Clarion.
An Alabama Justice of the Peace, in
one of the counties neighboring to Mobile,
has been arrested and taken before a
United States commissioner, at the suit of
a negro, under very singular circumstances.
The negro had been arrested for some mis>
demeanor, tried, found guilty, and con-
demned by the Justice to a term of im-
prisonment. He told the magistrate he
would rather be whipped than go to jail.
According to this request, the Judge or-
dered the constable to whip the negro,
which was done. The pain from the whip-
ping caused the negro to retract his choice
of punishment, and as soon as he was re-
leased he lodged a complaint with the
bureau. The Justice was released on
$1000 bail.
Burning of the Alabama.
By the arrival of the steamer J. M.
Sharp, this morning, we learn that the
steamer Alabama, Capt. Lee, from
Shreveport, bound to this city, caught
fire at 2 o’clock this morning, when
twenty-eight miles this side of Don-
aldsonville, and, together with her car-
go, consisting of nearly 1200 bales of
cotton, were entirely destroyed. Her
crew and passengers were all saved
and brought to this port by the J. M.
Sharp.
Great credit is due to Capt. Lee and
his officers for the efficient manner in
which they discharged their several
duties, as it was owing to their almost
superhuman exertions that the passen-
gers and crew were saved.
The fire spread so rapidly that the
clerks were unable to save their books
and papers. We also learn that she
was insured to the amount of forty
thousand dollars in a St. Louis com-
pany.—[N. O. Picayune, 1st inst.
To Regulate the Elective Franchise i11
all the States.
Mr. Wilson introduced a bill to regulate
the elective franchise in the United States
which provides that whereas the four-
teenth amendment of the Constitution has
been ratified by a sufficient number of
States, and is therefore a part of the fund-
amental law ; and whereas, the first sec-
tion of said article of amendment declares
that “all persons born or naturalized in
the United States and of the States where-
in they reside,” and that “no State shall
make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citi-
zens of the United States; and, whereas,
the said fourteenth article of amendment
empowers Congress to enforce, by appro-
priate legislation, the provisions of said
article: therefore, Be it enacted, &c.,
That there shall be no denial of the elec-
tive franchise to any male citizen of the
United States by any State on account of
color, race, or previous condition, anything
in the Constitution or laws of any State to
the contrary notwithstanding ; and that all
persons who violate the provisions of this
act shall, on conviction in any United
States Court, be fined for each offense no t
less than one thousand dollars, or be im-
prisoned notless than six months, or both.
Alluding to the above, the well-informed
Washington correspondent of the Balti-
more Gazette says:
That public liberty has been destroyed—
that the Radicals now deem themselves
strong enough to ignore the rights of the
Northern States in matters affecting solely
their domestic policy—is evident to tha
most casual observer. The bill of Mr.
Wilson, introduced in the Senate yester-
day, which assumes not only that the con-
stitutional amendment is already part of
the fundamental law of the land, but
places the matter of suffrage in those
States exclusively in the hands of Congress,
is not one of those advance measures put
forth by experimenters as feelers of the
public pulse. I have reason to know that
it is simply a matter of practical legisla-
tion, and will as certainly be adopted as
the sun will rise tc morrow! For nothing
will deter Congress from measures infin-
itely beyond even this, but an apprehen-
sion of resistance on the part of the
Northern people—and what probability is
there that a populace heartless enough to
have stolidly looked upon the subjection
of five millions of their fellowcountry- -
men to the dominion of a less number of
ignorant blacks, would make the slightest
sacrifice for the preservation of their own
liberty ?	________
After twenty years of obstinate resist-
ance, the Austrian Emperor has conceded
to Hungary nearly all that her gallant peo-
ple fought for in 1848- He has given
them their ancient constitution, recog
nized their right to their own independent
Parliament, given them a Ministry of their
own, and conceded that he can only be
King of Hungary -by coronation at the
hands of the Parliament. He has also
admitted to high place in the councils of
the nation some of those who were fore-
most in fighting her battles in 1848, and
who have since passed long years in exile
therefor.
Will the Southern people fail to profit
by this example? •
Chicago Water.—On the 25th ult.
the final opening of the lake tunnel for
use was celebrated with great “pomp
and ceremony” in Chicogo. There
were salutes from artillery, solemn
and impressive Masonic ceremonies,
an oration by Hon. Jno. B. Rice,
Mayor of Chicago, and speeches by
other gentlemen connected with the
enterprise. Twenty thousand persons
were present and participated in the
great rejoicing. The Times says:
Chicago has now the only thing
which it needed to make it the greatest
city in the world. Heretofore we have
been much in the condition of the un-
fortunate mariners who had “water,
water everywhere, but not a drop to
drink”; but now, having remedied this
one drawback, Chicago stands at the
front. As our size beats Cincinnati;
our prospects and opera-house New
York city, so does our lake water 6x-
cel the Croton water of the last named,
the Ohio river water of Cincinnati, and
the brown mixture used by St. Louis.
There is nothing whatever now lack-
ing to our superiority to every other
city on the continent. We have the
fastest people, the most enterprising
business men, the biggest rascals in
our bridewells and Board of Trade,
the prettiest women, the most extra-
ordinary future, and the purest, sweet-
est and best water of any place in ex-
istence.
Small by Degrees and Beautifully
Less.—Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts,
says the Crisis, now occupies the seat in
the Senate filled by Daniel Webster—his
colleague, Henry Wilson, that once filled
by Rufus Choate. Zachariah Chandler,
of Michigan, is now in the seat once filled
by Lewis Cass; Gratz Brown, of Missouri,
that once occupied by Thomas H. Benton,
and John Sherman that once filled by
Thomas Ewing and William Allen, from
Ohio. Can anything better illustrate the
degeneracy of the times than these facts?
The Force of Habit.—The phraseol-
ogy of Congressional reporters, says the
Colorado Times, has undergone a change.
Formerly, on the passage of a bill it was
said: “It only requires the signature of
the President to become a law.” Lately,
in chronicling the passage of a bill, a re1
porter says : ‘ ‘It now only awaits the veto
of the President to be passed into a law.”
Habit will accustom us to anything.
A long and able article in the Memphis
Appeal, of March 30th, entitled the
“Scoundrelism of war,” concludes as fol-
lows :
It gives us no pleasure to refer to these
things- There were other and more infa-
mous atrocities, which regard for the in-
nocent who suffered the last indignities,
during two hours’ license given by a Fed-
eral Colonel to a brutal soldiery, coven
with the veil of silence. If reconciliation
among the people and the States, was de>
sirable, all men should have been incited
to forget the Past; and the atrocities oi
Civil War should, if possible, have become
to us like a horrid dream. But when the
changes continue to be rung on Southern
inhumanity, to keep up the exasperation
of the Northern heart, and to cause them
to approve a. nriLtiry despotism and a gen-
eral confiscation, the South, bleeding from
ten thousand gaping wounds, ought not to
remain silent. And before the end oi
another year we hope that authentic ac
counts of the sufferings of Confederates in
Northern prisons will have been prepared
and published ; the authentic evidence of
the outrages and inhumanities of the
Northern soldieiy collected for the use oi
the future historian. If this is done, the
North will have cause to regret that it had
not kept a ; discreet silence when it was
possible for it to have secured our silence
by its own—a bargain which it would have
been very wise to make, since it had a
thousand-fold more to desire that the hor-
rors of the Past should be buried out of
sight and remembrance, than we have.
An exchange likens Radicalism to the
‘ ‘Aerial form of liberty. ’ ’ 1 ‘Aerial form’ ’
is good. Such, indeed, is liberty in our
land just now. Like Macbeth’s witches,
it has passed off into “thin air.” There
is no substance or body about it. It is
made of such stuff as dreams are, and
“baseless as the fantastic visions of the
evening.”
“Treason is to be made odious.” We
are glad to hear this, for it gives us assur-
ances that the Radical Rump is pretty
near the end of its tether. Until some of
its leaders are hung, treason can never be
made odious. Just now it has everything
its own way.
-------«i< i«-------------
The Fashionable Chains being
Discarded.—We are glad to observe
that the young ladies of our city have,
in a measure, quit the fashion of wear-
ing great chains around their necks.—
This fashion was adopted at the North
in derision when our beloved ex-Pres-
ident was manacled at Fortress Mon-
roe by his jailors ; adopted in derision
of the sufferings of our people when
defeated and stripped of the rights for
which they fought. We were sur-
orised when our ladies, whose hus-
bands, brothers and friends fought in
the Southern cause, adopted the fash-
ion and flung into the faces of their
defenders the taunt of which these
chains are emblematic. The popular
idea among very young men, that they
were worn to keep the dear “little
ones” from being wafted off to Para-
dise, is exploded, and we beseech the
fair sex to discard their chains with-
out delay, as it is not pleasant to have
such reminders of our defeat always
dangling before our eyes.—[Richmond
Times.	i
More.—More people have died in the
world of starvation than of eating pork.
When thunder claps, .for whom is the
applause intended?

Washington, March 31.—Mrs-Jefieri
son Davis is in Baltimore.
It is supposed that the executive session
of the Senate will continue two weeks.—
Many representatives will remain to watch
the appointments.
The President’s signing the acts giving
Brownlow 10,000 arms and accoutrements,
and suspending payment for enlisted slaves
causes comment. The Chronicle concludes
a paragraph: “We almost begin to be--
lieve he (the President) is disposed to let
Congress alone, and, like a good citizen, to
obey his superiors, and to teach others to
do so likewise.”
St. Louis, March 31.—The Lindell Ho-,
tel, the largest building of its kind on the
continent if not in the world, was totally
destroyed by fire last night. There is a
good deal of mystery as to the origin of
the fire, but the most reliable account is
that it broke out in the fifth story.
The building was owned by the estate of
Henry Ames & Co., Edward Ames being
the representative. Its original cost was a
little over $900,000. It was purchased by
Henry Ames & Co., two months after it
opened for $370,000. It was insured for
$310,000. The loss in furniture and
stores is $300,000, insured for $100,000.—
Loss in personal effects by guests $100,-
000. Loss in goods in stores underneath
the hotel $50,000. A number of citizens
have already expressed their determina-
tton to rebuild the hotel.
Havana, March 22.—A revolutionary
proclamation, signed by many prominent
citizens, has been received from Spain
calling upon all classes to rise overthrow
the Queen and establish a Republic.

Late Partingtonian.—The following
is the latest “Partingtonianism,” from the
pen of the inimitable Shillaber: “Have
you seen any lucubrating drops for a brom
chial deficiency,” said Mrs. Partington to
Dr. Withington, at the corner. “Is your
cold deep seated?” said the Doctor bland-
ly. “I don’t know how deep it is,” said
she, with a bark like an Esquimaux dog,
“but is lough enough, What a time for
colds this is, to be sure ; I declare I am
completely exaggerated with my cough.”
“You need an expectorant,” said the Doc-
tor. “I expect so,” replied she, “but
whether it will do any good or not must
depend upon how it affects me, but I will
take a box of atrocious lozenges anyhow,
which I have heard spoken of as melli-
fluous.” Ike spent his time in playing
with the dumb-bells: and the old lady
asked the Doctor to excuse the liberty he
took, because the boy was given to jimei
lastics-

Congress and the Dog.—Among the
best impromptu hits of the day was one
made by Brick Pomeroy yesterday. While
he was lecturing, a handsome Newfound-
land dog happened on the platform. After
walking around a while he came te Brick
who gently patting him, remarked*—
"Clever dog; if you were in New Eng-
land, they’d send you to Congress.”—
Whereupon there was a laugh, and the
dog very deliberately left the stage, when
Brick immediately added : "The dog even
is insulted at the offer. The Puritans
would only want him because he’s black.
If he’ll come back I’ll apologize.”—1 Co-
lumbus (G a.) Sun.	,
Watery.—The Red Bluff Independent
is responsible for the following: "Old
Slockbower, a worthy Teuton of Shasta
county, came up on the last boat and tells
the following story about the splendid site
selected for the rcd-and-white, barber’s-
pole-pattern State House: ‘De blace is

Mexican Customs.—The Abbe Domen-
ech, the Grand Almoner of the Emperor
Maximilian, has recently published a book
in Germany, entitled "Two Years in Mex-
ico,” which contains the following interes-
ting anecdotes:
On one occasion the Emperor called toi
gether his Cabinet. On the table was a
silver instand. Suddenly it vanished.
‘ ‘Where is it ?’ ’ said the Emperor. No
‘‘Gentlemen.’' said Maximillian, "I
shall -now carefully close the windows and
curtains of this room. In five minutes, I
shall open them again, and must find my
inkstand on the table. If it is not there
I will have you all arrested.”
The room was darkened, and when at
the expiration of the five minutes, the
room became light, the missing article
was on the table.
At another time Maximilian sat at a ta-
ble which was furnished with silver knives
and forks. When the meal was at an end,
his Majesty wrapped up the plate in a nap’
kin, with his own hands, and handed it to
a German servant, to whom he said, in
French, "Take care that the Mexican ser-
vants do not lay their fingers on these
things, or I shall lose them.’
Again : A criminal had been sentenced
to be garroted. A priest accompanied
him to the scaffold, and gave to the exe-
cutioner’s assistant his broad brimmed hat
to hold for a moment. After the delin-
quent had kissed the crucifix, the priest
turned around, but the assistant and the
hat had vanished.
A noble Mexican lady once told at court
that the previous night some scamps had
broken into her house, bound her to the
bed, and taken what money she had.—
"But/’said she, "they were true caball-
•eros, since I asked them not to step on my
lap dog, and they did not. Yes, tgere are
still welLbred people in Mexico,”

RIVER NEWS
The river has risen a little over two
inches during the last twenty-four hours.
The weather is mild and genial, and
business on the levee yesterday displayed
considerable activity.
ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES:
Magenta, Vicksburg to Nt O.; II. M.
Shreve, Vicksburg to St. Louis; Hope,
Vicksburg to Yazoo City; Ruth, N. O.
to St. Louis; Ned Tracy, St. Louis to
N. O.
The splendid steamer Nick Longworth
will leave this port to-day, for Louisville,
at 10 A. M. A. R. Irvine commanding,
Charley Miller clerk. W. M. Williams &
Co. are her agents.
The fine steamer Louisiana will leave for
Louisville to-morrow, (Thursday,) at 10
A. M.
The Louisville, for Louisville, will be
up Friday.
The fascinating Emma No. 2 leaves on
time this evening, for Tallahatchie river
and all intermediate dry points. Capt.
John O. Page has resumed his place on
deck. Geo. Connery and Ed. Jackson
still presiding in the office.
The A. & M. S- S. Co.’s fine packet
Mary E. Forsyth leaves this day, at 12 M.,
for St. Louis, Capt. Haney in command.
J. W Jennings, agent; T. R. Kirnan,
passenger agent.
The regular Deer Creek packet arrived
yesterday, and will take her departure for
Deer Creek the latter part of this week.
Jno. King, Master; Hardy Hendren
Clerk.
Nearly all the houses in DeSoto have
been tied up by their owners to trees, but
notwithstanding this precaution, many of
them have got loose and floated off down
the angry flood. Several houses from
somewhere up the country have also been
seen drifting rapidly past town.
We are informed by a gentleman from*
Yazoo, that there is scarcely a foot of land
visible from Yazoo City to Greenwood,
save an occasional solitary mound, covered
with wild and domestic animals. The
whole country presents a scene of blank,
watery desolation, positively fearful to
contemplate.
Numerous stores on the levee have
been deserted, and the goods moved
farther up town, and in some" of
them the water has reached a depth of
seven or eight feet. Those merchants who
were so highly posted on the hill, that
they felt no apprehensions from the high
water, are threatened with submersion.
A. L. Jaquith & Co. have moved out, and
Johnson & Lamkin will doubtless be com’
pelled to fall back to’day, notwithstanding
the large levee which was erected in front
of their establishment. On account of
seepage water in the lower story of the
Prentiss House, operations will perhaps
have to be suspended there in a few days.
The Henry M Shreve, from St. Louis,
was discharging yesterday, at the foot of
Grove street, and the piles of freight
reached almost beneath the window of our
sanctum, on Washington street.
The little tug Cleveland, while skeeting
around loose.yesterday, mistook the main
channel and ran aground directly in the
rear of the Times office.
One of the rarest sights which has per-
haps ever been seen in Vicksburg, was a
number of receiving and shipping clerks
yesterday,- checking freight almost at
Rentgea’s corner, on Washington street.
A Springfield correspondent of the Chi-
cago Tinies gives some interesting partic-
ulars of the great bridge, connecting St.
Louis wita Illino is:
The entire length of the bridge will be
2700 feet. The lowest part of the main
spans, or bottom chord, will be not less
than 50 feet above the city directril tindi'
eating the highest water mark) ac the
greatest span There will be two spans
over the main steamboat channel of 350
feet each, in the clear, not including the
abutments. Tie remainder of the spans
over the main river will not be less than
200 feet each, aad probably will be 250
each. There wiL be two spans from the
Missouri shore of the river over the levee ;
and it probably wll be foun 1 necessary to
bridge at least tvo streets besides the
above, on the St. Louis side, before com-
ing to a level grade. A portion ot the
slough on the Illinon side will also be
bridged. The total length of the bridge
over the main channel if the river will be
about 2000. The total length of bridging
over the streets in St. Louis and over the
slough on the Illinois shire will be about
700 feet—thus tnaking he entire length
of the bridge, as above, about 2700 feet.
The superstructure will be built o> iron,
and on Post’s patent plan. The roadway
will consist of two doubletrack carriage
ways, one single-track railwey, with tracks
on the latter to accommodate the different
gauges of the railroads centering at St.
Louis. The railway track wil run through
the two carriage tracks; the latter at the
ends passing under the railway, which will
run over them on bridges, tins keeping
the carriages and railway tracks from all
interference with each other.
Thus there will, in reality, be three
bridges over the river, abreast of each
other, which is equivalent to a single-track
bridge 8,100 feet long. In addition to the
carriage and railway tracks, there will be
two side walks, six feet wide erc'i, one at
each end of the bridge. The masonry
will be of the most substantial and massive
character and description. The miin piers
will be from 120 to 130 feet high fiom the
foundations, and will be 60 feet long on
the top, and 7 to 8 feet wide, with a
proper batten to their foundations. The
foundations will be very expensive, and it
may be necessary to use pneumatic piles
but it is hoped the ordinary piles will be
found sufficient. If so, they will be firnly
driven, sawed off at the bed of the river or
top of foundation, and the masonry low-
ered in iron caissons to its place.
The approximate cost of the entire
structure, it is estimate,d, will be about
$5,000,000, although this cannot be de-
termined until a thorough examination is
, made of the bed of the river.
