The following which we find in the
Mississippian, places the “in terrorem”
arguments of Judge Robb and other dis-
tinguished gentlemen in their proper
light. We ask from our readers a careful
perusal:
THE LETTER OF JUDGE ROBB.
[From the Herald of the 22d.
CARD OF COL. FLOWERREE.
SATURDAY MORNING, March 23, 1867.
“Joe Brown. Jr.’’—We cannot devi-
ate from our established rule, “To pub-
lish no communication unless the real
name of the author is.furnished.”
We learned yesterday through Mr. John
Lea, mail agent on the Southern Railroad,
that two smash-ups occurred on the Mo-
bile and (Him 'irrid ■ day before -yesterday.
One at Macon and the other at Sugalock.
Both freight trains. Great loss of pro-
perty. No lives lost.
Frantz, in his editorial correspondence
from New Orleans, rows us up Salt river—
for running away from him, and for ani-
madverting on the management of the St.
James Hotel. We stuck to him as long as
we “had a dollar in nw pocket;” and can
prove that we had to borrow money to pay
our bar-bill on the JI, E. Lee. Everybody
know that ’tis as inappropriate to be in
New Orleans broke, as to be at a Press
Convention sober. As far as the hotel is
concerned, it was no excuse for them that
“our personal appearance did not indicate
greatness.” On the contrary, ’tis rather
a reflection ; for a good landlord will make
no distinction in the tfeatment of his
guests.
Here’s what Frantz says:
The first old acquaintance I met was
that world-renowned humorist, Harry
Moss, of the Vicksburg Times. After
brushing up and eating a hearty breakfast,
Harry and “we” paid our friends of the
“quill and scissors” a visit, in order to get
our names in the papers, and to let the
world know that, Iwo distinguished iudi
viduals were in the city. We returned in
time for dinner, and whilst I was engaged
in conversation with a friend, Harry mys-
teriously disappeared. Alter a fruitless
search of an hour among the bar-rooms, I
finally learned that Hairy had taken pas-
sage on a boat for Vicksburg. I mourned,
I wept, I lamented, I felt bad, because
Harry had left me without saying “good-
bye,” after having promised to remain as
long as he had a dollar in his pocket. The
poor fellow had complained bitterly of the
treatment he received at the hands of the
proprietors of the St. James. He said
they had not. shown him that attention
which his eminent abili ies and wide-
spread reputation demanded. . I fried to
to console him with the reflection that his
personal a: '.-.ranee did not indicate
greatness, and that the proprietors had
not yet found out that he was the same
individual who danced with us at the Phoe-
nix Ball, waltzed with the Indian girl,
dined with the Grand Spizerinktum, and
drank lager beer with Ristori—that though
our reputation was not half so great as his,
yet our personal appearance indicated
greatness, and always commanded respect.
As soon as I had an opportunity of doing
so, I informed the proprietors that Harry
was a great man, no'withstanding his awk
ward personal appearance, and had he not
left so suddenly he would have been ten-
dered a complimentary party, and treated
with distinguished consideration.
One of the most plainly defined duties '
ol our people at the present critical jump
ture, is to stay at home, and -./tend to then-
own domestic interests, and, as far as possn
ble, foster commercial intercourse among
themselves.' Commenting upon this policy, '
the Macon Telegraph uses the following
language :
We urge this course not as a matter of
spite, but as a great political and economil
cal duty. We have now, and shall contin-
ue to have for a year or two to come, but
very little to buy with, and that little
should be spent among our own people,
thus making one interest tributary to
another and all combi ning to build up the
general strength. We shall, by pursuing
that course, be better enabled to live
through the troubles to come.—
It is a moral duty. The North has pro-
claimed us enemies and extended martial
law over us, and it is both unlawful and
wrong to trade with the enemy, at least
beyond the demands of absolute necessity.
“Nor shall our merchants lose money by
the operation, or their customers pay more
for what they buy. The wholesale dealers
of Macon, Savannah, Charleston, Mobile
and New Orleans announce their readiness
to furnish goods to the country merchant
on as good terms as he can get in the
Northern cities, and we should give them
the preference in trade, and especially
those who import their goods from abroad.
All the prime articles of consumption can
be found in the Southern markets, and to
such should our merchants confine them-
selves, and not by fashionable finery and
gewgaws seduce the people into habits of
extravagance and folly wholly unsuited to
these solemn times.
“Let our tradesmen follow this advice;
our planters devote the larger share of
their attention to grain instead of to cot-
ton ; our people everywhere eschew dis1
play and dissipation, and practice econot
my from the highest to the lowest; let
political agitation and agitators alone;
obey the laws however hard, and every idle
head and hand go to work at something—
do this, and we shall be not only indepen-
dent among ourselves,-but “terrible as an
army with banners” to those who would
oppress us. Herein lies the true power of
South in her day of peril. Would that
all our people could see the truth and
practice it.”
Clinton, March 20th, 1867.	<
Editor Mississippian:—I have examined 1
the letter of my old friend, Judge Robb, ‘
as I find it in a recent number of the Clar- 1
ion, with some care, and I am pleased to 1
learn that Mr. Barksdale pronounces it “a 1
calm, statesman-like and convincing ex-
position of the present condition of public
affairs.” Judge Robb says: “negro suf’
frage will be fastened upon us, and once
established as a fundamental law, what
hope is there for its abrogation?”
I agree there is none. The negroes out-
number our white population, and if we
establish them as our rulers by “the fund'
amental law,” our case is indeed hopeless.
Yet Judge Robb advises us to do that
tiling. He assumes that Congress can
make our “fundamental law” for us ; but
I disagree with Mr. Barksdale in his
views that the “exposition” upon this
point, is either “statesman-like” or “con-
vincing. ’ ’ We can rivet our own chains
and become indeed hopeless ; but Corn
gross can forge no enduring fetters for us.
Judge Robb finally tells us just what
sort of a bad thing he advises us to do.—
He says; “I cannot view negro suffrage in
any other light than that of an unmitiga-
ted evil, without the slightest tincture or
alloy of good, leading eventually either to
the extinction of his race upon this conti-
nent, or, through civil convulsions, to the
final overthrow of the Republic and the
extinguishment of liberty in the Western
Hemisphere.” Surely this prescription of
the Clarion, as described by Judge Robb,
is as fatal as can be ; yet he commends
this poison as our only hope of safety !
My friend, Mr. Barksdale, reccomm ends
the Extract of Africa as, in the present
condition of the patient, the only “restor1
er’ ’ of the South ; and the cry has gone
forth: “Try Smoland r’s- Take no other
, other Bucliu. ” He calls my friend Judge
Robb to depose to the unequaled merits
of this grand specific; and he testifies as
follows:
“It follows as night the day that when
an ignorant horde of stupid and
besotted men (negroes,) destitute of
intelligence, of patriotism, of pride, and
of exalted sentiment, are to enjoy the
elective franchise and control the destinies
of the republic, its fate is sealed, the prop
which supperts it is gone.”
If this testimony be true, the medicine
is fatal, and I rather prefer to dismiss the
doctor and take the chances of recovery.
If my friend, Dr. Robb, intends to enter
upon an extensive political practice, and
to rely on that remedy for his cures, I ad-
vise him to secure a township, at the
least, for the accommodation of his pa-
tients.
Some faintly hopeful persons have ven-
tured to suggest the possibility, admitted
te he very remote, that, by abject submis’
sion to acts denounced as arbitrary and un-
constitutional, our estates may possibly be
spared. But my friend proclaims all such
fancies to be mere illusions. He says:
“The Legislative branch of the Govern-
ment at the close of the war, was control-
ed by a party whose animosity towards us
knew no bounds, and who determined the
instant we became subject to their power,
to resist and prevent any plan of recon-
struction which did not insure the perpet-
uation of their power, as well as gratify
their malignity.
“Our action can have no effect upon
Congress. They have their programme and
nothing that we can do will make them
swerve from it. They have never regarded
our acts except with a view to find pre-
texts to justify their policy. If confisca’
tion is necessary to the accomplishment of
their purpose, in perpetuating power,
which is their chief design, I believe they
will not scruple to do so. They may peri
ceive in a few months that confiscation or
further disfranchisement is necessary.”
That is the cream of the matter. “Noth-
ing that we can do” will tend to ’delay the
full accomplishment of the Radical plan,
in the opinion of Judge Robb. It will
neither hinder nor delay confiscation. In
his view, we have no hope; for he des-
pairs of the other departments of the
Government. And therefore he, some-
how, concludes that “we have something
of loss to risk, and nothing of gain to hope
by delay. The sooner the matter is set-
tled, and we gain a voice in Congress, the
better for us.”
But my friend has testified that the
Radicals are intent to “insure the perpet-
uation of their power, as well as gratify
their malignity” against us; and that
“nothing that we can do will make them
swerve “from their plans;” and thus has
he upset himself!
My friend deals a blow at a policy which
I was rather inclined to favor, until I
read his letter. I allude to the policy of
those who advise our people to cleave to
the Constitution, and trust to the ultimate
triumph of right and justice. These gem
tiemen admit that nothing we can do may
prevent the temporary imposition of negro
suffrage, but they look forward, hopefully,
to the time when evil passions, engendered
by war, shall cease—when the Constitu-
tion shall once more become the supreme
law of the land—when all that has been
done by usurpation against our consent,
shall be an lulled, and Liberty and Law
shall again triumph together. They warn
us not to rivet our own chains : for then
our slavery will be perpetual. But my
friend, Robb, has a novel way to dispose
of such devices. Ho grants the possibility
of ultimately avoiding any plan of negro
suffrage that Congress may impose upon
us, against our consent. But he suggests
that we might so come to like the thing,
as to be wholly unwilling to give it up. I
quote his words : ‘ ‘The new system having
become settled and acquisced in for such a
length of time, we do not know whether
it would th en be really to our interests or
in accordance with the sympathies of our
people to disturb the existing order of
things. ’ ’
That suffices.	UNION.
Editor Herald :—I notice in yes- :
terday’s issue of your paper animad-
versions on Pickett’s division of Gen.
Lee’s army, which seems to me both
unjust and uncalled for. I have not a
word to say against other commands
or commanders. Nor have I any de-
fense to make of Gen. Pickett or his
command. But, while I sincerely de-
precate any reflections on or invidious
comparisons of the conduct of the offi-
cers or soldiers of our noble armies, as
a member of that division, I deem it
an honorable duty to speak for my
command that which Gens. Lee and
Longstreet recognize as true.
As to the doings of Pickett’s divis-
ion at the battle of Gettysburg, I will
only say that the reports of Gens. Lee
and Longstreet and history itself, have
made a record of their heroic bearing
and splendid charge on the cemetery
hill, which may confidently defy all at-
tempts to tarnish its lustre.
If any corroboration of this record
could be necessary, it is traced in the
blood of brave men on that memora-
ble field in characters so legible that
blind prejudice itself cannot fail to
read it.
Pickett’s division, at the battle of
Gettysburg, was composed of Armi-
stead’s, Kemper’s and Garnett’s brig-
ades, (Corse’s having been detailed to
guard the railroad from Richmond to
Gordonsville,) numbering in the ag-
gregate about thirty-eight hundred
men. Armistead was shot down while
mounted on one of the enemy’s guns ;
Garnett was killed at the stone fence,
and Kemper was so fearfully wound-
ed, that his old regiment thought it
expedient to make a coffin for his in-
terment. Thirty of the thirty-two
field officers present were either killed
or wounded, and more than fifty per
cent, of the rank and file were victims
of this bloody charge. This charge
shed lustre on our arms, and elicited
from Gen. Lee unqualified encomiums,
and applause from the whole army.
When Longstreet’s corps was trans-
ferred to Georgia. Pickett’s division
being empty as to all save its glorious
name, was left to guard the approaches
to Richmond and recruit its wasted
strength. Within a few months it had
grown comparatively strong, and in
February following was marshalled in
front of Newbern with like results as
attended the efforts of the two other
divisions of Longstreet’s corps before
Knoxville about the same time.
On the third of April following a
brigade of this division was a part of
the expedition under General Hoke
which captured Plymouth.
General Robert Ransom, who com-
manded two brigades of this division,
in the attack on Butler in his works in
front of Drury’s Bluff, on the 16th of
May following, pauses in his report of
that engagement, to compliment in a
special manner the gallantry of the
troops on that occasion.
When this division was reviewed at
Richmond, in March, 1864, by General
Breckenridge, then Secretary of War,
the expressed opinion was that this di-
vision presented the handsomest ap-
pearance in drill, discipline and num-
bers, ever paraded as a division in the
army of Northern Virginia.
The reports of the Inspector will
disclose any quantity of proof of my
statements; and you are referred to
the reports of the various officers men-
tioned herein.
When, on the morning of the 31st of
March, the cstValry had failed to carry
the enemy’s works on the Creek be-
yond Mrs. Gilliam’s house in Dinwid-
dle, a few regiments from Pickett’s di-
vision accomplished the perilous task
—wading through water waist deep,
in the charge. During the day, part of
this division was several times engaged
hand to hand with the enemy. Nor
did they succumb to the perils and
hardships of this arduous contest, un-
til, on the first of April, the day fol-
lowing, their rear was attacked and
two brigades on their left had been
routed and dispersed.
I may safely hazard the statement
that, when the final catastrophe came,
no division in the army of Northern
Virginia could boast of more Cam-
hronnes, who in their hearts despised
Fate and preferred death to surrender,
than this. Very respectfully,
C. C. FLOWERREE,
Late Colonel 7th Virgina Infantry,
Pickett’s Division.

THE SPRING- FASHIONS.
peplum basque, eaeh having something in
its favor. A short, loose sacque, a trifle
shorter at the sides than the back and
front, and beautifully trimmed, is very at-
tractive.
The short dresses for the street are made
plain at the top, with plaits at the back,
both ol which are fashionable. The skirt
is usually cut with points around the bot-
tom, and is worn over a plaited petticoat
of the same material, but the petticoat is
often made plain, aud when trimmed with
graduated bands of velvet is very pretty,
and many prefer it to the plaited. Every-
thing in the way of dress is elaborately
trimmed.
The styles in children’s dress are various,
as usual. Lithographic prints of pretty
faces, in a frame work of golden curls, are !
attached to figures to represent children
from two or three years up to ten years.
The figures are dressed in the latest mode,
even to the dainty garter.
Bonnets.
The spring styles in bonnets have not
yet been brought out, except at the open-
ing of the importers, when the milliners
gathered up all the novelties and ordered
them home immediately, where they will
be hidden until the general opening day.
Some change has taken place in shapes,
but it is not so great as many predicted
in early winter. When the small bonnets
of the past year made their appearance,
the universal belief was that they would
not be worn more than a season. But they
have survived the winter, and the ladies
declare they are almost as much in love
with them as ever, especially when they
remember the “coal scuttle” or “sky-sera’
per,” or the Quaker like bonnet that hides
the “little face divine.” The fact that
large bonnets would conceal much beautiful
hair, natural or artificial, that now adorns
the heads of the ladies, will effectually
keep them at their distance.

THE BALM OF MEMORY.
’Tis over now—the hope that gilded life,
And with its music cheered the past long
years,
lias faded all away and left us naught,
Naght save our memories and tears.
Tears which refresh the heart, yet may
bring
Back unto life the beauty of its spring.
not
’Tis over now—and we who wept and prayed
That night would usher in a gladsome day,
May only clasp a shadow to our hearts,
And see them bear our faded hopes away.
Thank God! we claim a memory all bright,
Star-like, undimmed, though all, all else is
night.
A memory Time’s shadow cannot dim;
A memory eternal as yon stars;
A memory that clings to every heart;
A memory oppression never mars.
This still remains, a balm of magic power,
One ray to gild the darkness of the hour.
The memory of battles fought and won;
Of weary marches borne without a sigh;
Of deeds of matchless glory and renown;
Of hero “names that were not born to die.’’
What though we furl our fiag and lay it low!
’Tis stained with martyrs’ blood, immortal
now.
STYLES OF DRESSES, HOOPS AND BONNETS.
The season favors the fashions. The
short jackets and sacques and the infinites’
imal bonnets of the past season were not

are suitably clothed for the milder temper-
ature of March.

by a much smaller hoop, and, when pro
portioned to the figure, the new ones are
far more graceful both for in-door and
out-door wear.
Ladies Dresses-
The gored dress, so long in fashion, will
be the prevailing style for the coming sea-
son. It is made plain at the top—or with
plaits at the back, according to taste. For
the house, the skirt is very wide at the
bottom, with a long train. For receptions
this skirt is very suitable.
In street dresses there is a decided and
apparently popular change. The short
dresses, with petticoat to match, are a
great improvement upon the looped-up
dresses, with trains which would gomes
times escape from the best of loopers to
sweep the streets-' These short dresses re’
quire a sacque or jacket to be worn with
them, and are generally made en suite.
Shawls cannot be worn with them; they
have too heavy a look, and are not grace’
ful with the new short dress.
The interesting event of last week among
the fashiommakers was the opening of
dress patterns by Madame Demorest. Be
sides these, theip were patterns of mantil-
las, sacques, &c., and for children’s cloth-
ing a great variety of styles. The coat
sleeve is still to some extent a favorite,
but gradually the flowing sleeve isgainifig
popularity, and no doubt will have many
admirers before the summer is over. Some
of the designs for these sleeves are very
pretty and novel. One is a half-flowing
sleeve over a coat sleeve, or a coat sleeve
open on the outside and laced, with the
loose flowing sleeve falling gracefully over
the elbow.

THE OPERA.
To Impressario Roncari and Mana-
ger John Templeton, we are indebted
for the present season of grand Italian
Opera. After long years of experi-
ence in Europe, Havana and the City
of Mexico, Signor Roncari matured a
taste which resulted in the organiza-
tion of the present Operatic Combina-
tion. The same director who intro-
duced the exquisite Steffen one, and
tutored Vestvali, is a fitting manager
for the present favorites, Signora Cat-
tiffari, Elisa Tomasi, Gebele Fabbri,
Oltaviani, Strozzi, Boetti, Rocco Salar-
es Munguia, and the grand company.
That the Italian Opera appears at the
is due entirely to the
generous outlay and business tact of
Mr local manager.
■“Il Tro vat ore,” the masterpiece of
tfie immortal Verdi, was the selection
for the first subscription night. "Er
nani” was selected, but was delayed in
consequence of the slight indisposition
of the great Baritone, Signor Ottavia-
ni
■ "Il Trovatore” and "Eruani,” are
matchless compositions which breathe
the soul and spirit of Verdi, the grand
maestero. "Martha,” is of the sweet do-
mestic style, a chef d'ouvre. In the Tro-
vatore, Cattinari, who is a powerful
singer and a superb actress, thrilled
and electrified the audience. Especi-
ally was this the case in the Cavatina
■>f the first act, in the duos with the
■?ount De Luna and Manrico. The
■elebrated Miserere/ elicited a grand
Becall which was prolonged until a re-
L-Meat of the thrilling dirge toney stilled
■he assemblage. Boetti sung the role
' Jpf Manrico with great taste. Strozzi,
& superb baritone, rendered the Count
-	Luna with so masterly a finish and
■execution as to merit several recalls.—
■The Trezetto and finale of act first,
-	[was a triumph which was extended—
■by an appreciative audience, such as
faVicksburg boasts—to all the grand
■scenas, Arias, Chorusses and Orches-
.'1 rial beauties of the Opera.
I The Gipsey Camp scene, at the open-
■hig of act second, introduced the ac-
complished contralto, Frida Gebele,
M who «ang with the greatest feeling, es-
■necia'11V-in the Duo with Manrico and
Mbe Frison
■	Afterthp V‘<crere> the impression
■of the evening, was Srand finale
■	of the second act, by tn? soprano, ten-
■	or, baritone and chorus. ^^^a
■	Donna Cattinari, Boeti and ^rozzi,
■acknowledged the rapturous encore?/
The Anvil Chorus, so familiar, and so
■	inspiriting, was somewhat faulty, not in
■	correctness, but in force and vigor. For
■	this scene, the chorus should have been
■	doubled.
The finest dramatic effect of Trovatore
I is in the encounter between the contend-
I ing tactions, and in the death scene of
I Leonora—both were admirable.
Wdjave said that Cattinari is a grand
I actress? We have only to add, that her
I dying voice, and failing action, were the
I perfection of art.
Signors Salares, Munguia and others,
filled their respective roles most admirably.
The Miserere scene was excellent—the
costuming worthy of especial mention,
i though the accuracy thereof should have
reached a point, which would have sug-
gested the appropriate changes for the
role of Leonora.
"Martha” was given last night, introdm
cing the Elisa, Tomasi, Prima Donna,
whose sweet cultivated voice still haunts
us. Signor Fabbri the favorite tenor,
sang Leonella with thorough finish. Rocco
is the finest Basso we have listened to for
years.
To-night, the delightful Opera of "Er1
nani.” First appearance of the superior
Baritone, Ottaviani.

J. W. GRAY & CO
In the last 24 hours, the river has risen
only a little over 2 inches, which we are
very happy to say is a considerable abate-
ment from the daily rise of the past few
days.
The rivers above are all falling rapidly,
and the prospect for the subsiding of the
waters is now extremely encouraging,
The Swallow passed down yesterday
morning, and we learn from her officers,
that she came from Cincinnati to Cairo on
the fall.
The river has fallen considerably at Cin-
cinnati, and is declining slowly at St.
Louis, Cairo, Louisville and Nashville.
Tom Richards, of the Calumet, which
came in yesterday evening, informs us
that the Yazoo and Tallahatchie and Cold
Water Rivers, are higher by several inches
than they were during the great overflow
of ’62, but they are now at a stand. <
The weather is clear and warm, the sun <
having again displayed his genial phiz.
Business on the levee is quite dull, and t
the arrivals and departures have been very r
few.	]
Since our last report, the Hornet passe 1
down from Cincinnati to New Orleans,
with coal bargee.
The Marble City and T. L. McGill
passed down, and the Leonidas up.
The gay little tug- Fern leaves to-day for
Louisville, to be completely repaired, and
we are informed by her skipper, that she
will shortly return looking as pretty as a
"speckled pup.”
The Calumet leaves this evening for
Yazoo and Tallahatchie rivers. Shum
Parisot is her dignified deck walker, and
Tom Richards, Chunk Battaiie, and John
Dent are his hunkadory bowers.
The Quitman did not get in yesterday
evening, on time., but arrived last night.
We had the pleasure of a call from Capt.
Cannon, yesterday evening. He informs
us that the Lee and Quitman will extend
their trips to Memphis for the present
only, or until such time an business opens
here again. It is not his intention to
leave the Vicksburg trade, as he has too
many friends here, and appreciates then-
past favors too much, to with draw his boat
from it. It is needless for u*s to say any
thing commendatory of these magnificent
steamers. They are such as Vicksburg
or any other city should feel proud to have
as packets.
We are surprised that the river reports
er of the Herald should have classed our
mild comment on the article of Capt. Buck
in relation to the conduct of the Captain
of the St. Patrick, under the head of "se-
vere strictures.” He ought to just see us
get our back up once, if.he wants to see
some "show^nuff” "severe strictures,”
and we affectionately advise the sweet
youth to mind his points, or we’ll give him
a specimen. He’s a promising boy, and
will do well in the world, if he don’t try to
fly too high. Look sharp, sonny!
The Memphis Appeal of the 20th, says :
On Monday, the river fell about 1 inch
at Greenville, Miss- The fall at Helena
was about 4 inches in 4 days. On Thurs-
day Deer Creek rose 14 inches, caused by
the breaking of the levee at Miller's bend.
From Deer Creek to Greenville the coun-
try was submerged. Point Chicot and a
few other in Arkansas are not submerged.
In Bolivar county,. Miss., there but few
places that are yet high and dry.
The St. Louis Times, of Monday says :
Although the river here and the rivers
above are steadily falling, a few warm days
will cause another rise. There is a large
Amount of snow along the banks.
’ '^here are several large tows of grain in
the Zhinois river southward bound.—
Among L.hem are the Kellogg, Storm, and
S. C. Bakef with tows of ice for Nashville
and Vicksburg. .The Monongahela is at '
Jersey landing vrith a tow of canal boats
loaded with pork and grain for St. Louis.
St. Louis exchanges of Tuesday have
the following:
This moment the business prospects
are cheering. Boats are again under
way in the three upper rivers. The
id ver 8 continue to fall, but will no
doubt be swelling within three days.
The weather is again mild, and snows
and ice melting.	.
Receipts from above and shipments
southwa^'d will be large this week.
Freight is not abundant yet for the
Missouri bi?t numbers of travelers are
seeking transport up that stream. Sev-
eral mountain boats were receiving
freight, the rates being ten cents per
pound, or not muc h less. It is rumor-
ed that two or three boats on the long
list for Fort Benton ti*?is season, have
determined to leave the track.
No change was made in rates ot
freight yesterday; last w'Cek’s rates
will doubtless continue throughout
this week. Tonnage is abundant. There
isquite a crash of boats at the wharf.
The considerable number expected in
to-day will have trouble in getting
close to the bank.
The Southern Belle is from the high-
est point on the Mississippi of any
boat this season. She reached the solid
ice spanning the river, six miles below
Burlington, and two hundred and
eighty-three miles from St. Louis.—
The ice is gorged on the bars to the
hight of fifteen or twenty feet, and the
river was falling rapidly all the way
down. The contract for transporting
Government goods this season up the
Missouri will be awarded either to
Fred.Dozier or JohnG.Copelin. There
is about a million and a half of money
in it.
---------- E >	» -----------__________
The Washington correspondent of
the Mobile Times, sketching Congress,
says : "I must not forget John Mor-
rissey, who was once in the prize-ring,
and who has since been a “ gay gam-
bollier,” but who is now a millionaire.
He is a stalwart, broad shouldered,
ample chested man, with waving black
hair, and always dressed in the ex-
treme of fashion. Many a sneaking,
time-serving politician envies him his
manly proportions, his frank manner,
and his honest bearing. He visits
the telegraph operator in the House
postoffice frequently, and conducts his
stock operations in Wall street as
steadily as though he was in New
York.”
