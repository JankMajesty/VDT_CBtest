DR. BURIN DU BUILSON’S '
Digestive Lozenges and Powders of the Al-
caline Lactates.
The Alcaline Lactates exercise the mostfben;
efleial influence of er the derangements <rf diges-
tion, either by their peculiar action on the mu-
cous membrane ofthe stomach, or by affording
to the latter torough their eombination with the
saliva to the gastric jhie*, a tzuMlyof Lactic acid,
which all English, French and other plmiolo-
gists, admit to b* an essential principle of diges-
tion. For the information of those who may be
without medical advice,.it may be stated here
that the symptoms of Impaired digestion are:
headache,painintheforehead,hemierama, gas-
tritis, heartburn. Wind in toe stomach and bow-
els, loss of appetite, emaciation, eto. All these
soon appear under the action of toe Alcaline Lac-
tates, which may be always had in Lozenges or
Powders. ' . 7T7 '

CAN CONSUMPTION BE CURED?
This question is so anxiously asked by the
Consumptives, out answer is, that Pulmonary
Consumption, or other diseases of the Lungs,
ate as curable as any otEr diseases if the right
remedies are promptly used. That it can be
cured there is no doubt, as hasbeen repeatedly
and amply proved by autopsies on thousands of
bodies of men and women in the Hospitals oi
Europe; these autzfosiesshowing that the cica-
trization of toe cavities Of the lungs had been
affected during the life of Me patient, proving
conclusively that CousuntzNon can be cured I
The next question arises as to the means. On
that subject there exists as great a variety of
opinions as there-are practitioners—some advo-
cating one theory, and some another. It is ad-
mitted by all the Frofejsi<m,toat the discoverer
of any remedy which Would generally relieve
and cure Phthisis, Tubercular and Pulmonary
Consumption, would be the greatest benefactor
of the age. The cure has been discovered and
IS daily relieving thousands who would other-
wise have been victims Of toe grave. Pectoral
Balm is the Great Remedy; and for«l diseases
of the Pulmonar Organs stands wifhout' afi
equal. The Proprietor, confident of the impar-
tial judgment and honor of the^rofession, will
cheerfully furnish atottle of Pectoral Balm to
any respectable Physician, so that a fair trial
can be given of . its merits, and a true report
given. All that Is asked is, that the sufferer
from any,Bronchial diseases tries it. and we
gre satisfied he will recommend it to all.
