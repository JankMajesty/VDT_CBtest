What class of people will be most susceptible
to attacks from Cholera?
Evidently those anected with any disease of
the stomach, liver, or any of the organs apper-
taining to digestion. This class of persons un-
doubtedly will be more liable to contract th!
disease than those possessed of strong and
healthy digestive organs.
The question then naturally arises, how shall
we restore and keep these organs in a healthy
and normal condition? We answer, by atten-
tion to diet, avoiding all undue excitement,
using moderate exercise, avoiding all intoxicat- i
ing drinks, no matter in what form presented
and by the use, according to directions, of that
great strengthening tonic,

Broadway, March 29,1866.
Dear Sir—I take great pleasure in testifying I
to the extraordinary remedial qualities of the
Hoofland’s German Bitters, procured at your I
Ntablishmont.
A member of the family has been for many
years a perfect Martyr to Dyspepsia, Palpita-
tion of the Heart, and other distressing off-
spings ol a torpid liver, until persuaded to try
the above celebrated remedy, which in a few
weeks resulted in making her (to use her own L
words) "a new woman.” .
You are at liberty to make any use of this you
see fit, or refer similar sufferers to
Yours, truly, A. MoMAKIN.
From the Rev. Levi G. Beck, Pbstorof the Bap-
tist Church. Pemberton, N. J., formerly of the
North Baptist Churcn, Philaaelphia, at pres-
ent Pastor of the Baptist Church, Chester, Pa.

I have known Hoofland’s German Bitters fa-
vorably for a number of years. I have used
them in my own family, and have been so
pleased witn their effects that I was induced to
recommend them to many others, and know
that they have operated in a strikingly benefi-
cial manner. I take great pleasure in thus pub-
licly proclaiming this fact, and calling the at-
tention of those afflicted with the diseases for
which they are recommended, to this Bitters,
knowing from experience that my recommend-
ation will be sustained. 1 do this more cheer-
fully as Hoofland’s Bitters is intended to benefit
the afflicted, and is not a "rum drink.”
Yours, truly. LEVI G. BECK*
