SYNOPSIS OF THE BANKRUPT
BILL.
?RES 10—CHANGE.
New Orleans, March 11, 1867.
1 I ailed 11٦٦ last ٤0 101ل from Mem-
phis 01) Friday evening at 3 o'clock,
and 1110 next night at ٤ reasonable
hour 1 stood at 1110 butt 9111 0٤ 8 rye
straw 111 the Chafe Imperial, and suck-
91 ٤0 110 health 0٤ 0 Vicksburg
Times.
When 1 10٤ Memphis, 0٤ 101008 *1ه
^old snow covcied the ground, except
where it 1100 0001 converted info lush
by vehicles and pedcstrians-and from
٤119 Railroad 1000٤ as 11٠ 88 could 100
1110 ,0011؟ house-tops were 0٤ a frigid-
ly uniform 111 0٠ا
Yesterday 1 ate green 10988 for din-
1191٠ with may feet under ٤110 mahogo-
ny 0٤ Capt. 10111 Burke of our State—
،01 however, 1 presume, 1٤٤10111 9٢9118م
1 urke 0٤ ours,,’ but 1 swear 1٤, ever.v
111011 و clever a fellow, and so was 1ع
Iffndfathei, before him.
11119 Railroad Convention, 110 Mem-
})his, adjourned 011 Friday, 8111 about
،inety of 1110 delegates having 002108-
01 for ٤110 express purpose, determin-
1 10 visit 1110 Crescent City, and yours
ruly, concluded ’twould be a nice item
0 be there 1910 they arrived, and in
order to do 80 successfully, came along
with the crowd-and ،،a merry, 1091٠٠٠٧
rowd w ere ٤1101 ween.” 1٤ was, per-
11108, the gayest assortment 0٤ men
01158 100 ever passed together over
that route.
Railroads from 811 part« of thecoun-
ry. North and South, 01٠9 represent-
;d. but the hunkadoriest boy 0٤ 211
that festive crew, was Sam Carey, 0٤
110 Mississippi Central, which, 401٠0-
؛ هlid facetious 01199, 1٤1 1118 inimita-
1,10 drollery, 1910٤ everybody stretched
011 11٤ر the laugh, from that 0114 0٤٤110
.034 to this. ح few perapetetic 101111-
osophers 0٤ ٤10 Press, dignified the
occasion with their presence.
Havfeig so very recently left 8 1211
where 011 Boreas holds 111و frozen
sway, 1 001 scarcely realize ٤119 0518٤-
91100 0٤ the balmy air, 4111 blooming
gardens, 0111 kite flying children 0٤
1110	Crescent City-a linen duster
١vould actually be comfortable, 201
،nint juleps are as 001110011 as Radicals
ill hell.
Apropos.-On account 0٤ ٤110 810-
prehensions 0٤ a riot, the election
١٧ 111011 was to have 001110 off yesterday,
was postponed-just my poor-folky
luck. To miss a riot!
But 1 have seen Ristori—and remain-
01 through 1110 11010 performance of
10011, the forsaken 00٢٢088, 009021189 1
considered 1119 100٤ of having “paid
my 100110٧٤0 see the sho١٢,”oneof the
rarest episodes 111 1لا romantic and
eventful life.
I	٤001 fully prepared to put 110 411
018101.40 critique 011 this celebrated
lady, but “owing to the scarcity of my
valuable space,” 0٤٤ ٠ the early hour 0٤
(going 10 mail,” 0٤ ٠119 “press of other
,natter,” or 1110 ‘inauspicious war,mth
of ٤110 weather,” or the “lateness of 100
hour,” 0 anything else you please, 1
,,,, unable ٤0 00 so.
Beyond a 101110ا, however, Ristori is
2؛ sublimaciously stupendicular, trage-
kist, but about her “kno١ving her part”
-011 cant prove ا by 1109, for the 011-
ly thing 1 understood, 0٠ 311 other
١vords, comprehended, ٢48 when, 111
the last act, she accidental,’ sneezed,
0و God 1و my judge, that’s all the
English 1 100014 and 1 suppose 802
would have done that 1 Italian 1 she
had known how.
When 2119 was launching all her tu-
١) 111 ٤٠ boiler, nitro-glycerine maledic-
011و upon the 11011 011 10010 she had
vrongly 0110111401 for a 111802110, she
111, as near 488 1 0211 remember, “Dam-
،،etti puguosseto pedeleta.and an old
؛ent from the country, who sat next
0 me, exclaimed—“Geeminny crack-
;y ! EF she didn’t call him a ل--ل fug-
osed pedler.”
Ristori is an ACTRESS, and 1٤ any 0119
ver has, SHE has measured 1110 height
١111 sounded the depths 0٤ tragedy.
1ا seemed to 1100, last night, that at
