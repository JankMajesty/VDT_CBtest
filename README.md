# The Vicksburg Daily Times Digital Collection

A digital collection of the Vicksburg Daily Times, a Reconstruction Era newspaper from Vicksburg, Mississippi (1860s). This collection features digitized newspaper images from the Briscoe American History Center.

This site is built using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/collectionbuilder-gh/), a free and simple digital collection site generator using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## About This Project

This digital collection was created as part of a Digital Libraries class project, working with historical newspaper materials from the Briscoe American History Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

For information about the CollectionBuilder template used to create this site, visit the [CollectionBuilder Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/).

**Note:** 
Since CollectionBuilder-GH uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it is only suitable for small collections, with lower resolution images. 
GitHub repositories are limited to 1GB.
For larger collections or those that require more customization, check out the [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) template.

## CollectionBuilder 

<https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.
